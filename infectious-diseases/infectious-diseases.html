			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Infectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms — such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful. But under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.</p>
			<p>Some infectious diseases can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by insects or other animals. And you may get others by consuming contaminated food or water or being exposed to organisms in the environment.</p>
			<p>Signs and symptoms vary depending on the organism causing the infection, but often include fever and fatigue. Mild infections may respond to rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections may need hospitalization.</p>
			<p>Many infectious diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, can be prevented by vaccines. Frequent and thorough hand-washing also helps protect you from most infectious diseases.</p>

	<div id="symptomes" class="col-9">
		<h2>Symptomes</h2>
		<p>Each infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fever</li>
			<li>Diarrhea</li>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Mucsle aches</li>

		<h2>Causes</h2>
		<p>Each infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h5>Bacteria</h5>
				<p>These one-cell organisms are responsible for illnesses such as strep throat, urinary tract infections and tuberculosis.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Viruses</h5>
				<p>Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases ranging from the common cold to AIDS.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Fungi</h5>
				<p>Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, are caused by fungi. Other types of fungi can infect your lungs or nervous system.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Parasites</h5>
				<p>Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite. Other parasites may be transmitted to humans from animal feces.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h4>Direct Contact</h4>
		<p>An easy way to catch most infectious diseases is by coming in contact with a person or an animal with the infection. Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact such as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h5>Person to person</h5>
				<p>Infectious diseases commonly spread through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another. This can happen when an individual with the bacterium or virus touches, kisses, or coughs or sneezes on someone who isn't infected..</p>
				<p>These germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact. The person who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Animal to person</h5>
				<p> Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal — even a pet — can make you sick and, in extreme circumstances, can be fatal. Handling animal waste can be hazardous, too. For example, you can get a toxoplasmosis infection by scooping your cat's litter box.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Mother to unborn child</h5>
				<p>A pregnant woman may pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby. Some germs can pass through the placenta or through breast milk. Germs in the vagina can also be transmitted to the baby during birth.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h4>Indirect Contact</h4>
		<p>Disease-causing organisms also can be passed by indirect contact. Many germs can linger on an inanimate object, such as a tabletop, doorknob or faucet handle.</p>
		<p>When you touch a doorknob handled by someone ill with the flu or a cold, for example, you can pick up the germs he or she left behind. If you then touch your eyes, mouth or nose before washing your hands, you may become infected.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Insect Bites</h4>
		<p>Some germs rely on insect carriers — such as mosquitoes, fleas, lice or ticks — to move from host to host. These carriers are known as vectors. Mosquitoes can carry the malaria parasite or West Nile virus. Deer ticks may carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Food Contamination</h4>
		<p>Disease-causing germs can also infect you through contaminated food and water. This mechanism of transmission allows germs to be spread to many people through a single source. Escherichia coli (E. coli), for example, is a bacterium present in or on certain foods — such as undercooked hamburger or unpasteurized fruit juice.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="riskfactors" class="col-9">
		<h2>Risk Factors</h2>
		<p>While anyone can catch infectious diseases, you may be more likely to get sick if your immune system isn't working properly. This may occur if:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You're taking steroids or other medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs for a transplanted organ</li>
			<li>You have HIV or AIDS</li>
			<li>You have certain types of cancer or other disorders that affect your immune system</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition, certain other medical conditions may predispose you to infection, including implanted medical devices, malnutrition and extremes of age, among others.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="complications" class="col-9">
		<h2>Complications</h2>
		<p>Most infectious diseases have only minor complications. But some infections — such as pneumonia, AIDS and meningitis — can become life-threatening. A few types of infections have been linked to a long-term increased risk of cancer:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Human papillomavirus is linked to cervical cancer</li>
			<li>Helicobacter pylori is linked to stomach cancer and peptic ulcers</li>
			<li>Hepatitis B and C have been linked to liver cancer</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition, some infectious diseases may become silent, only to appear again in the future — sometimes even decades later. For example, someone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles much later in life.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="prevention" class="col-9">
		<h2>Prevention</h2>
		<p>Each infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h5>Wash your hands</h5>
				<p>This is especially important before and after preparing food, before eating, and after using the toilet. And try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands, as that's a common way germs enter the body.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Get vaccinated</h5>
				<p>Vaccination can drastically reduce your chances of contracting many diseases. Make sure to keep up to date on your recommended vaccinations, as well as your children's.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Stay home when ill</h5>
				<p>Don't go to work if you are vomiting, have diarrhea or have a fever. Don't send your child to school if he or she has these signs, either.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Prepare food safely</h5>
				<p>Keep counters and other kitchen surfaces clean when preparing meals. Cook foods to the proper temperature, using a food thermometer to check for doneness. For ground meats, that means at least 160 F (71 C); for poultry, 165 F (74 C); and for most other meats, at least 145 F (63 C).</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Practice safe sex</h5>
				<p> Always use condoms if you or your partner has a history of sexually transmitted infections or high-risk behavior</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Don't share personel items</h5>
				<p>Use your own toothbrush, comb and razor. Avoid sharing drinking glasses or dining utensils.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Travel wisely</h5>
				<p>If you're traveling out of the country, talk to your doctor about any special vaccinations — such as yellow fever, cholera, hepatitis A or B, or typhoid fever — you may need</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>What is chickenpox?</h3>
			<p>Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It can cause an itchy, blister-like rash. The rash first appears on the chest, back, and face, and then spreads over the entire body, causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and people with a weakened immune system. The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Anyone who has not had chickenpox or gotten the chickenpox vaccine can get the disease. Chickenpox illness usually lasts about 4 to 7 days.</p>
			<p>The classic symptom of chickenpox is a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters that eventually turn into scabs. The rash may first show up on the chest, back, and face, and then spread over the entire body, including inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital area. It usually takes about one week for all of the blisters to become scabs.</p>
			<p>Other typical symptoms that may begin to appear 1-2 days before rash include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fever</li>
				<li>tiredness</li>
				<li>loss of appetite</li>
				<li>headache</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some people who have been vaccinated against chickenpox can still get the disease. However, the symptoms are usually milder, with fewer or no blisters (or just red spots), mild or no fever, and shorter duration of illness. But some vaccinated people who get chickenpox may have disease similar to unvaccinated people.</p>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Complications from chickenpox can occur, but they are not common in healthy people who get the disease.</p>
			<p>People who may get a serious case of chickenpox and may be at high risk for complications include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Infants</li>
				<li>Adolescents</li>
				<li>Adults</li>
				<li>Pregnent women</li>
				<li>People with weakened immune systems because of illness or medications, for example, people with HIV/AIDS or cancer/Patients who have had transplants, and/People on chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, or long-term use of steroids.</li>
				<p>Serious complications from chickenpox include:</p>
				<li>Bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues in children, including Group A streptococcal infections</li>
				<li>Infection of the lungs (pneumonia)</li>
				<li>Infection or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis, cerebellar ataxia)</li>
				<li>Bleeding problems (hemorrhagic complications)</li>
				<li>Bloodstream infections (sepsis)</li>
				<li>Dehydration</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some people with serious complications from chickenpox can become so sick that they need to be hospitalized. Chickenpox can also cause death.</p>
			<p>Deaths are very rare now due to the vaccine program. However, some deaths from chickenpox continue to occur in healthy, unvaccinated children and adults. In the past, many of the healthy adults who died from chickenpox contracted the disease from their unvaccinated children.
			</p>
			<h3>Transmission</h3>
			<p>Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The virus spreads easily from people with chickenpox to others who have never had the disease or never been vaccinated. The virus spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has chickenpox.</p>
			<p>The varicella-zoster virus also causes shingles. Chickenpox can be spread from people with shingles to others who have never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine. This can happen through close contact with someone who has shingles.</p>
			<p>A person with chickenpox is contagious beginning 1 to 2 days before rash onset until all the chickenpox lesions have crusted (scabbed). Vaccinated people who get chickenpox may develop lesions that do not crust. These people are considered contagious until no new lesions have appeared for 24 hours.</p>
			<p>t takes about 2 weeks (from 10 to 21 days) after exposure to a person with chickenpox or shingles for someone to develop chickenpox. If a vaccinated person gets the disease, they can still spread it to others. For most people, getting chickenpox once provides immunity for life. However, for a few people, it is possible to get chickenpox more than once; although, this is not common.</p>
			<h3>Prevention and Treatment</h3>
			<h4>Prevention</h4>
			<p>The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine. Everyone – including children, adolescents, and adults – should get two doses of chickenpox vaccine if they have never had chickenpox or were never vaccinated.</p>
			<p>Chickenpox vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing the disease. Most people who get the vaccine will not get chickenpox. If a vaccinated person does get chickenpox, the symptoms are usually milder with fewer or no blisters (they may have just red spots) and mild or no fever.</p>
			<p>The chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe illness. Since the varicella vaccination program began in the United States, there has been over 90% decrease in chickenpox cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.</p>
			<h4>Treatments at Home for People with Chickenpox</h4>
			<p>There are several things that you can do at home to help relieve chickenpox symptoms and prevent skin infections. Calamine lotion and a cool bath with added baking soda, uncooked oatmeal, or colloidal oatmeal may help relieve some of the itching. Try to minimize scratching to prevent the virus from spreading to others and potential bacterial infection from occurring. Keeping fingernails trimmed short may help prevent skin infections caused by scratching blisters.</p>
			<h4>Over-the-counter Medications</h4>
			<p>Do not use aspirin or aspirin-containing products to relieve fever from chickenpox. The use of aspirin in children with chickenpox has been associated with Reye’s syndrome, a severe disease that affects the liver and brain and can cause death. Instead, use non-aspirin medications, such as acetaminophen, to relieve fever from chickenpox. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends avoiding treatment with ibuprofen if possible because it has been associated with life-threatening bacterial skin infections.</p>
			<h4>When to Call a Healthcare Provider</h4>
			<p>For people exposed to chickenpox, call a healthcare provider if the person:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Has never had chickenpox and is not vaccinated with the chickenpox vaccine</li>
				<li>Is pregnant</li>
				<li>Has a weakened immune system caused by disease or medication; for example: A person with HIV/AIDS or cancer, A person who has had a transplant, or A person on chemotherapy, immunosuppressive medications, or long-term use of steroids.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Call a healthcare provider if:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					The person is at risk of serious complications because he or she:
					<ul>
						<li>Is less than 1 year old</li>
						<li>Is older than 12 years of age</li>
						<li>Has a weakened immune system</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<br>
				<p>OR</p>
				<li>
					The person develops any of the following symptoms:
					<ul>
						<li>Fever that lasts longer than 4 days</li>
						<li>Fever that rises above 102°f (38.9°c)</li>
						<li>Any areas of the rash or any part of the body becomes very red, warm, or tender, or begins leaking pus (thick, discolored fluid), as these symptoms may indicate a bacterial infection</li>
						<li>Difficult waking up or confused behavior</li>
						<li>Difficulty walking</li>
						<li>Stiff neck</li>
						<li>Frequent vomiting</li>
						<li>Difficulty breathing</li>
						<li>Severe cough</li>
						<li>Severe abdominal pain</li>
						<li>Rash with bleeding or bruising (hemorrhagic rash)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<img src="Flu-or-Common-Cold-1024x683.jpg" class="img-fluid">
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Common Cold?</h3>
			<p>The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. Many types of viruses can cause a common cold.</p>
			<p>Children younger than 6 are at greatest risk of colds, but healthy adults can also expect to have two or three colds annually.</p>
			<p>Most people recover from a common cold in a week or 10 days. Symptoms might last longer in people who smoke. If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Sore throat and runny nose are usually the first signs of a cold, followed by coughing and sneezing. Most people recover in about 7-10 days. You can help reduce your risk of getting a cold: wash your hands often, avoid close contact with sick people, and don’t touch your face with unwashed hands..</p>
			<p>Common colds are the main reason that children miss school and adults miss work. Each year in the United States, there are millions of cases of the common cold. Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more.</p>
			<p>Most people get colds in the winter and spring, but it is possible to get a cold any time of the year. Symptoms usually include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sore throat</li>
				<li>runny nose</li>
				<li>coughing</li>
				<li>sneezing</li>
				<li>headaches</li>
				<li>body aches</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Most people recover within about 7-10 days. However, people with weakened immune systems, asthma, or respiratory conditions may develop serious illness, such as bronchitis or pneumonia.</p>
			<h3>How to protect yourself</h3>
			<p>Viruses that cause colds can spread from infected people to others through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected through contact with stool (poop) or respiratory secretions from an infected person. This can happen when you shake hands with someone who has a cold, or touch a surface, like a doorknob, that has respiratory viruses on it, then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose.</p>
			<p>You can help reduce your risk of getting a cold:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water</li>
				<p>Wash them for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Viruses that cause colds can live on your hands, and regular handwashing can help protect you from getting sick.</p>
				<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands</li>
				<p> Viruses that cause colds can enter your body this way and make you sick</p>
				<li>Stay away from people who are sick</li>
				<p>Sick people can spread viruses that cause the common cold through close contact with others.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>How to Protect others</h3>
			<p>If you have a cold, you should follow these tips to help prevent spreading it to other people:</p>
			<p>Stay at home while you are sick and keep children out of school or daycare while they are sick.</p>
			<p>Avoid close contact with others, such as hugging, kissing, or shaking hands.</p>
			<p>Move away from people before coughing or sneezing.</p>
			<p>Cough and sneeze into a tissue then throw it away, or cough and sneeze into your upper shirt sleeve, completely covering your mouth and nose.</p>
			<h3>Causes of common cold</h3>
			Many different respiratory viruses can cause the common cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common. Rhinoviruses can also trigger asthma attacks and have been linked to sinus and ear infections. Other viruses that can cause colds include respiratory syncytial virus, human parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, human coronaviruses, and human metapneumovirus.
			<h3>How to Feel Better</h3>
			<p>There is no cure for a cold. To feel better, you should get lots of rest and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter medicines may help ease symptoms but will not make your cold go away any faster. Always read the label and use medications as directed. Talk to your doctor before giving your child nonprescription cold medicines, since some medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Learn more about symptom relief of upper respiratory infections, including colds.</p>
			<p>Antibiotics will not help you recover from a cold caused by a respiratory virus. They do not work against viruses, and they may make it harder for your body to fight future bacterial infections if you take them unnecessarily. Learn more about when antibiotics work.</p>
			<h3>When to See a Doctor</h3>
			<p>You should call your doctor if you or your child has one or more of these conditions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>symptoms that last more than 10 days</li>
				<li>symptoms that are severe or unusual</li>
				<li>if your child is younger than 3 months of age and has a fever or is lethargic</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You should also call your doctor right away if you are at high risk for serious flu complications and get flu symptoms such as fever, chills, and muscle or body aches. People at high risk for flu complications include young children (younger than 5 years old), adults 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease.</p>
			<p>Your doctor can determine if you or your child has a cold or the flu and can recommend treatment to help with symptoms.</p>
			<h3>Know the Difference between Common Cold and Flu</h3>
			<p>The flu, which is caused by influenza viruses, also spreads and causes illness around the same time as the common cold. Because these two illnesses have similar symptoms, it can be difficult (or even impossible) to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. In general, flu symptoms are worse than the common cold and can include fever or feeling feverish/chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue (tiredness). Flu can also have very serious complications. CDC recommends a yearly flu vaccination as the first and best way to prevent the flu. If you get the flu, antiviral drugs may be a treatment option.</p>

			<h3>What is Diphtheria?</h3>
			<p>Diphtheria (dif-THEER-e-uh) is a serious bacterial infection that usually affects the mucous membranes of your nose and throat. Diphtheria is extremely rare in the United States and other developed countries, thanks to widespread vaccination against the disease. Diphtheria can be treated with medications..</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Diphtheria can infect the respiratory tract (parts of the body involved in breathing) and skin. Symptoms of diphtheria depend on the body part that is affected.</p>
			<h4>Respiratory diphtheria</h4>
			<p>The bacteria most commonly infect the respiratory system, which includes parts of the body involved in breathing. When the bacteria get into and attach to the lining of the respiratory system, it can cause:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>weakness</li>
				<li>Sore throat</li>
				<li>Mild fever</li>
				<li>Swollen glands in the neck</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The bacteria make a toxin (poison) that kills healthy tissues in the respiratory system. Within two to three days, the dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. Medical experts call this thick, gray coating a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making it very hard to breathe and swallow.</p>
			<p>If the toxin gets into the blood stream, it can cause heart, nerve, and kidney damage.</p>
			<h4>Diphtheria skin infection</h4>
			<p>The bacteria can also infect the skin, causing open sores or ulcers. However, diphtheria skin infections rarely result in any other severe disease.</p>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Complications from respiratory diphtheria (when the bacteria infect parts of the body involved in breathing) may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Airway blockage</li>
				<li>Damage to the heart muscle (myocarditis)</li>
				<li>Nerve damage (polyneuropathy)</li>
				<li>Loss of the ability to move (paralysis)</li>
				<li>Kidney failure</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For some people, respiratory diphtheria can lead to death. Even with treatment, about 1 in 10 patients with respiratory diphtheria die. Without treatment, up to half of patients can die from the disease.</p>
			<h3>Causes and spread to others</h3>
			<p>Diphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of bacteria called Corynebacterium diphtheriae that make a toxin (poison). It is the toxin that can cause people to get very sick.</p>
			<p>Diphtheria bacteria spread from person to person, usually through respiratory droplets, like from coughing or sneezing.  People can also get sick from touching infected open sores or ulcers.</p>
			<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
			<p>Diphtheria can infect the respiratory tract (parts of the body involved in breathing) and skin. Diagnosis and treatment depend on the type of diphtheria someone has.</p>
			<h4>Diagnosis</h4>
			<p>Doctors usually decide if a person has diphtheria by looking for common signs and symptoms. They can swab the back of the throat or nose and test it for the bacteria that cause diphtheria. A doctor can also take a sample from an open sore or ulcer and try and grow the bacteria. If the bacteria grow and make a toxin (poison), the doctor can be sure a patient has diphtheria. However, it takes time to grow the bacteria, so it is important to start treatment right away if a doctor suspects respiratory diphtheria.</p>
			<h4>Treatment</h4>
			<p>Diphtheria treatment today involves:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using diphtheria antitoxin to stop the toxin made by the bacteria from damaging the body. This treatment is very important for respiratory diphtheria infections, but it is rarely used for diphtheria skin infections.</li>
				<li>Using antibiotics to kill and get rid of the bacteria. This is important for both diphtheria infections in the respiratory system and on the skin.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>People with diphtheria are usually no longer able to infect others 48 hours after they begin taking antibiotics. However, it is important to finish taking the full course of antibiotics to make sure the bacteria are completely removed from the body. After the patient finishes the full treatment, the doctor will run tests to make sure the bacteria are not in the patient’s body anymore.</p>	
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<h4>Vaccination</h4>
			<p>Keeping up to date with recommended vaccines is the best way to prevent diphtheria.</p>
			<p>In the United States, there are four vaccines used to prevent diphtheria: DTaP, Tdap, DT, and Td. Each of these vaccines prevents diphtheria and tetanus; DTaP and Tdap also help prevent pertussis (whooping cough).</p>
			<h4>Antibiotics</h4>
			<p>MedsPlzz recommends that close contacts of someone with diphtheria receive antibiotics to prevent them from getting sick. Experts call this prophylaxis. This is important for people with diphtheria infecting the respiratory system (parts of the body involved in breathing) and skin.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Giardiasis?</h3>
			<p>Giardiasis is a diarrheal disease caused by the microscopic parasite Giardia. A parasite is an organism that feeds off of another to survive. Once a person or animal (for example, cats, dogs, cattle, deer, and beavers) has been infected with Giardia, the parasite lives in the intestines and is passed in feces (poop).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Giardiasis is the most frequently diagnosed intestinal parasitic disease in the United States and among travelers with chronic diarrhea. Signs and symptoms may vary and can last for 1 to 2 weeks or longer. In some cases, people infected with Giardia have no symptoms.</p>
			<p>Acute symptoms include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Diarrhea</li>
				<li>Gas</li>
				<li>Greasy stools that tend to float</li>
				<li>Stomach or abdominal cramps</li>
				<li>Upset stomach or nausea/vomiting</li>
				<li>Dehydration (loss of fluids)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other, less common symptoms include itchy skin, hives, and swelling of the eye and joints. Sometimes, the symptoms of giardiasis might seem to resolve, only to come back again after several days or weeks. Giardiasis can cause weight loss and failure to absorb fat, lactose, vitamin A and vitamin B12</p>
			<p>In children, severe giardiasis might delay physical and mental growth, slow development, and cause malnutrition.</p>
			<h3>Diagnosis and Detection</h3>
			<p>Because Giardia cysts can be excreted intermittently, multiple stool collections (i.e., three stool specimens collected on separate days) increase test sensitivity. The use of concentration methods and trichrome staining might not be sufficient to identify Giardia because variability in the concentration of organisms in the stool can make this infection difficult to diagnose. For this reason, fecal immunoassays that are more sensitive and specific should be used.</p>
			<p>Rapid immune-chromatographic cartridge assays also are available but should not take the place of routine ova and parasite examination 2. Only molecular testing (e.g., polymerase chain reaction) can be used to identify the subtypes of Giardia.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Several drugs can be used to treat Giardia infection. Effective treatments include metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide. Alternatives to these medications include paromomycin, quinacrine, and furazolidone. Some of these drugs may not be routinely available in the United States.</p>
			<p>Different factors may shape how effective a drug regimen will be, including medical history, nutritional status, and condition of the immune system. Therefore, it is important to discuss treatment options with a healthcare provider.</p>

		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is HIV/AIDS?</h3>
			<p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested. You can’t rely on symptoms to tell whether you have HIV.</p>
			<p>Knowing your HIV status gives you powerful information so you can take steps to keep yourself and your partner(s) healthy:</p>
			<h4>Stage 1: Acute HIV Infection</h4>
			<p>Within 2 to 4 weeks after infection with HIV, about two-thirds of people will have a flu-like illness. This is the body’s natural response to HIV infection.</p>
			<p>Flu-like symptoms can include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fever</li>
				<li>Chills</li>
				<li>Rash</li>
				<li>Night sweats</li>
				<li>Muscle aches</li>
				<li>Sore throat</li>
				<li>Fatigue</li>
				<li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
				<li>Mouth ulcers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. But some people do not have any symptoms at all during this early stage of HIV.</p>
			<p>Don’t assume you have HIV just because you have any of these symptoms—they can be similar to those caused by other illnesses. But if you think you may have been exposed to HIV, get an HIV test.</p>
			<h4>Stage 2: Clinical Latency</h4>
			<p>In this stage, the virus still multiplies, but at very low levels. People in this stage may not feel sick or have any symptoms. This stage is also called chronic HIV infection.</p>
			<p>Without HIV treatment, people can stay in this stage for 10 or 15 years, but some move through this stage faster.</p>
			<p>If you take HIV treatment every day, exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you can protect your health and prevent transmission to others. But if your viral load is detectable, you can transmit HIV during this stage, even when you have no symptoms. It’s important to see your health care provider regularly to get your level checked.</p>
			<h4>Stage 3: AIDS</h4>
			<p>If you have HIV and you are not on HIV treatment, eventually the virus will weaken your body’s immune system and you will progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). This is the late stage of HIV infection.</p>
			<p>Symptoms of AIDS can include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rapid weight loss</li>
				<li>Recurring fever or profuse night sweats</li>
				<li>Extreme and unexplained tiredness</li>
				<li>Prolonged swelling of the lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck</li>
				<li>Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week</li>
				<li>Sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals</li>
				<li>Pneumonia</li>
				<li>Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids</li>
				<li>Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Transmission</h3>
			<p>You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.</p>
			<p>Only certain body fluids—blood, semen (cum), pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum), rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur. Mucous membranes are found inside the rectum, vagina, penis, and mouth.</p>
			<p>HIV is spread mainly by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Having anal or vaginal sex with someone who has HIV without using a condom or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV.
					<ul>
						<li>For the HIV-negative partner, receptive anal sex (bottoming) is the highest-risk sexual behavior, but you can also get HIV from insertive anal sex (topping).</li>
						<li>Either partner can get HIV through vaginal sex, though it is less risky for getting HIV than receptive anal sex.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Sharing needles or syringes, rinse water, or other equipment (works) used to prepare drugs for injection with someone who has HIV. HIV can live in a used needle up to 42 days depending on temperature and other factors.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Less commonly, HIV may be spread:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>From mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding. Although the risk can be high if a mother is living with HIV and not taking medicine, recommendations to test all pregnant women for HIV and start HIV treatment immediately have lowered the number of babies who are born with HIV.</li>
				<li>By being stuck with an HIV-contaminated needle or other sharp object. This is a risk mainly for health care workers</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Anyone can get HIV, but you can take steps to protect yourself from HIV.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Get tested for HIV</li>
				<p>Talk to your partner about HIV testing and get tested before you have sex. Use this testing locator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to find an HIV testing location near you.</p>
				<li>Choose less risky sexual behaviors</li>
				<p>HIV is mainly spread by having anal or vaginal sex without a condom or without taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV.</p>
				<li>Use condoms every time you have sex</li>
				<p>Read this fact sheet from CDC on how to use condoms correctly.</p>
				<li>Limit your number of sexual partners</li>
				<p>The more partners you have, the more likely you are to have a partner with poorly controlled HIV or to have a partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Both of these factors can increase the risk of HIV transmission.</p>
				<li>Get tested and treated for STDs</li>
				<p>Insist that your partners get tested and treated, too. Having an STD can increase your risk of getting HIV or spreading it to others.</p>
				<li>Talk to your health care provider about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)</li>
				<p> PrEP is an HIV prevention option for people who don't have HIV but who are at risk of getting HIV. PrEP involves taking a specific HIV medicine every day to reduce the risk of getting HIV through sex or injection drug use. For more information, read the AIDSinfo fact sheet on Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP).</p>
				<li>Don't inject drugs</li>
				<p>But if you do, use only sterile drug injection equipment and water and never share your equipment with others.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Currently, there's no cure for HIV/AIDS. Once you have the infection, your body can't get rid of it. However, there are many medications that can control HIV and prevent complications. These medications are called antiretroviral therapy (ART). Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be started on ART, regardless of their stage of infection or complications.</p>
			<p>ART is usually a combination of three or more medications from several different drug classes. This approach has the best chance of lowering the amount of HIV in the blood. There are many ART options that combine three HIV medications into one pill, taken once daily.</p>
			<p>Each class of drugs blocks the virus in different ways. Treatment involves combinations of drugs from different classes to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Account for individual drug resistance (viral genotype)</li>
				<li>Avoid creating new drug-resistant strains of HIV</li>
				<li>Maximize suppression of virus in the blood</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Two drugs from one class, plus a third drug from a second class, are typically used.The classes of anti-HIV drugs include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) </strong>turn off a protein needed by HIV to make copies of itself. Examples include efavirenz (Sustiva), rilpivirine (Edurant) and doravirine (Pifeltro).</li>
				<li><strong>Nucleoside or nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) </strong>are faulty versions of the building blocks that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include abacavir (Ziagen), tenofovir (Viread), emtricitabine (Emtriva), lamivudine (Epivir) and zidovudine (Retrovir). Combination drugs also are available, such as emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada) and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (Descovy).</li>
				<li><strong>Protease inhibitors (PIs) </strong>inactivate HIV protease, another protein that HIV needs to make copies of itself. Examples include atazanavir (Reyataz), darunavir (Prezista) and lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra).</li>
				<li><strong>Integrase inhibitors</strong> work by disabling a protein called integrase, which HIV uses to insert its genetic material into CD4 T cells. Examples include bictegravir sodium/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide fumar (Biktarvy), raltegravir (Isentress) and dolutegravir (Tivicay).</li>
				<li><strong>Entry or fusion inhibitors</strong> block HIV's entry into CD4 T cells. Examples include enfuvirtide (Fuzeon) and maraviroc (Selzentry).</li>

			<h3>What is Influenza Flu?</h3>
			<p>Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Influenza (flu) can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu is different from a cold. Flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
				<li>cough</li>
				<li>sore throat</li>
				<li>runny or stuffy nose</li>
				<li>muscle or body aches</li>
				<li>headaches</li>
				<li>fatigue(tiredness)</li>
				<li>some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults.</li>
				<p>*It’s important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>How Flu Spreads</h3>
			<p>Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze or talk. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person might get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose or possibly their eyes.</p>
			<h4>Who is most likely to be infected with influenza?</h4>
			<p>The study found that children are most likely to get sick from flu and that people 65 and older are least likely to get sick from influenza. Median incidence values (or attack rate) by age group were 9.3% for children 0-17 years, 8.8% for adults 18-64 years, and 3.9% for adults 65 years and older. This means that children younger than 18 are more than twice as likely to develop a symptomatic flu infection than adults 65 and older.</p>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes.</p>
			<h4>People at High Risk from Flu</h4>
			<p>Anyone can get flu (even healthy people), and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age, but some people are at high risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), pregnant women, and children younger than 5 years.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>The first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Flu vaccine has been shown to reduce flu related illnesses and the risk of serious flu complications that can result in hospitalization or even death. CDC also recommends everyday preventive actions (like staying away from people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes and frequent handwashing) to help slow the spread of germs that cause respiratory (nose, throat, and lungs) illnesses, like flu.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>There are influenza antiviral drugs that can be used to treat flu illness. There are four FDA-approved antiviral drugs recommended by CDC to treat flu this season.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>oseltamivir phosphate (available as a generic version or under the trade name Tamiflu®)</li>
				<li>zanamivir (trade name Relenza®)</li>
				<li>peramivir (trade name Rapivab®)</li>
				<li>baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza®).</li>

		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Maleria?</h3>
			<p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease. It’s typically transmitted through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry the Plasmodium parasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>The symptoms of malaria typically develop within 10 days to 4 weeks following the infection. In some cases, symptoms may not develop for several months. Some malarial parasites can enter the body but will be dormant for long periods of time.</p>
			<p>Common symptomes include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>shaking chills that can range from moderate to severe</li>
				<li>high fever</li>
				<li>profuse sweating</li>
				<li>headache</li>
				<li>nausea</li>
				<li>vomiting</li>
				<li>abdominal pain</li>
				<li>diarrhea</li>
				<li>anemia</li>
				<li>muscle pain</li>
				<li>convulsions</li>
				<li>coma</li>
				<li>blood stools</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Complicaations</h3>
			<p>Malaria can cause a number of life-threatening complications. The following may occur:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>swelling of the blood vessels of the brain, or cerebral malaria</li>
				<li>an accumulation of fluid in the lungs that causes breathing problems, or pulmonary edema</li>
				<li>organ failure of the kidneys, liver, or spleen</li>
				<li>anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells</li>
				<li>low blood sugar</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>Malaria can occur if a mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans: Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum.</p>
			<p>P. falciparum causes a more severe form of the disease and those who contract this form of malaria have a higher risk of death. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her baby at birth. This is known as congenital malaria.</p>
			<p>Malaria is transmitted by blood, so it can also be transmitted through:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an organ transplant</li>
				<li>a transfusion</li>
				<li>use of shared needles or syringes</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>There’s no vaccine available to prevent malaria. Talk to your doctor if you’re traveling to an area where malaria is common or if you live in such an area. You may be prescribed medications to prevent the disease.</p>
			<p>These medications are the same as those used to treat the disease and should be taken before, during, and after your trip.</p>
			<p>Talk to your doctor about long-term prevention if you live in an area where malaria is common. Sleeping under a mosquito net may help prevent being bitten by an infected mosquito. Covering your skin or using bug sprays containing DEET] may also help prevent infection.</p>
			<p>If you’re unsure if malaria is prevalent in your area, the CDC has an up-to-date mapTrusted Source of where malaria can be found.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Malaria can be a life-threatening condition, especially if you’re infected with the parasite P. falciparum. Treatment for the disease is typically provided in a hospital. Your doctor will prescribe medications based on the type of parasite that you have.</p>
			<p>In some instances, the medication prescribed may not clear the infection because of parasite resistance to drugs. If this occurs, your doctor may need to use more than one medication or change medications altogether to treat your condition.</p>
			<p>Additionally, certain types of malaria parasites, such as P. vivax and P. ovale, have liver stages where the parasite can live in your body for an extended period of time and reactivate at a later date causing a relapse of the infection.</p>
			<p>If you’re found to have one of these types of malaria parasites, you’ll be given a second medication to prevent a relapse in the future.</p>

			<h3>What is Tuberculosis?</h3>
			<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that usually affects the lungs, though it can affect any organ in the body. It can develop when bacteria spread through droplets in the air. TB can be fatal, but in many cases, it is preventable and treatable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<h4>Early warning signs</h4>
			<p>A person should see a doctor if they experience:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a persistent cough, lasting at least 3 weeks</li>
				<li>phlegm, which may have blood in it, when they cough</li>
				<li>a loss of appetite and weight</li>
				<li>a general feeling of fatigue and being unwell</li>
				<li>muscle or body aches</li>
				<li>swelling in the neck</li>
				<li>a fever</li>
				<li>night sweats</li>
				<p>chest pain</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Symptoms</h4>
			<p><strong>Latent TB </strong>A person with latent TB will have no symptoms, and no damage will show on a chest X-ray. However, a blood test or skin prick test will indicate that they have TB infection.</p>
			<p><strong>Actie TB </strong>A person with TB disease may experience a cough that produces phlegm, fatigue, a fever, chills, and a loss of appetite and weight. Symptoms typically worsen over time, but they can also spontaneously go away and return.</p>
			<h4>Beyond the lungs</h4>
			<p>TB usually affects the lungs, though symptoms can develop in other parts of the body. This is more common in people with weakened immune systems. TB can cause:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>persistently swollen lymph nodes, or “swollen glands”</li>
				<li>abdominal pain</li>
				<li>joint or bone pain</li>
				<li>confusion</li>
				<li>a persistent headache</li>
				<li>seizures</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Without treatment Tb can be fatal.</p>
			<p>If it spreads throughout the body, the infection can cause problems with the cardiovascular system and metabolic function, among other issues.</p>
			<p>TB can also lead to sepsis, a potentially life threatening form of infection.</p>
			
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>M. tuberculosis bacteria cause TB. They can spread through the air in droplets when a person with pulmonary TB coughs, sneezes, spits, laughs, or talks.</p>
			<p>Only people with active TB can transmit the infection. However, most people with the disease can no longer transmit the bacteria after they have received appropriate treatment for at least 2 weeks.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Ways of preventing TB from infecting others include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>getting a diagnosis and treatment early</li>
				<li>staying away from other people until there is no longer a risk of infection</li>
				<li>wearing a mask, covering the mouth, and ventilating rooms</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>TB Vaccination</h4>
			<p>In some countries, children receive an anti-TB vaccination — the bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine — as part of a regular immunization program.</p>
			<p>However, experts in the U.S. do not recommend BCG inoculation for most people unless they have a high risk of TB. Some of the reasons include a low risk of infection in the country and a high likelihood that the vaccine will interfere with any future TB skin tests.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>With early detection and appropriate antibiotics, TB is treatable. The right type of antibiotic and length of treatment will depend on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the person’s age and overall health</li>
				<li>whether they have latent or active TB</li>
				<li>the location of the infection</li>
				<li>whether the strain of TB is drug resistant</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Treatment for latent TB can vary. It may involve taking an antibiotic once a week for 12 weeks or every day for 9 months.</p>
			<p>Treatment for active TB may involve taking several drugs for 6–9 months. When a person has a drug resistant strain of TB, the treatment will be more complex.</p>
			<p>It is essential to complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms go away. If a person stops taking their medication early, some bacteria can survive and become resistant to antibiotics. In this case, the person may go on to develop drug resistant TB.</p>
			<p>Depending on the parts of the body that TB affects, a doctor may also prescribe corticosteroids.</p>
