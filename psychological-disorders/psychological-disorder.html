			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Psychological Disorders (also referred to as mental illness, mental disorders, or psychiatric disorder) are a pattern of thought or behavior that is outside the expected norms and impairs an individualâ€™s ability function in ordinary life in some way. Such disorders are generally defined by examining how a person feels, acts, thinks or perceives. These disorders are just one part of mental health, but they are an important part.</p>
			<p>The causes of psychological disorders are varied and in some cases unclear. The theories often incorporate findings from a range of fields. Assessments are carried out by psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and clinical social workers, using various methods which rely on observation and questioning.</p>
			<p>Clinical treatments are provided by various mental health professionals. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options, as are social interventions, peer support, and self-help. In a minority of cases, there might be involuntary detention or involuntary treatment, where legally allowed and necessary. Stigma and discrimination often add to the suffering and disability associated with mental disorders (or with being diagnosed or judged as having a mental disorder), leading to various social movements attempting to increase understanding and challenge social exclusion. Prevention is now appearing in some mental health strategies.</p>

<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="symptomes" class="col-12">
		<h2>Signs and symptomes</h2>
		<p>Signs and symptoms of mental illness can vary, depending on the disorder, circumstances and other factors. Mental illness symptoms can affect emotions, thoughts and behaviors.</p>
		<p>Examples of signs and symptoms include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Feeling sad or down</li>
			<li>Confused thinking or reduced ability to concentrate</li>
			<li>Excessive fears or worries, or extreme feelings of guiltExtreme mood changes of highs and lows</li>
			<li>Withdrawal from friends and activities</li>
			<li>Significant tiredness, low energy or problems sleeping</li>
			<li>Detachment from reality (delusions), paranoia or hallucinations</li>
			<li>Inability to cope with daily problems or stress</li>
			<li>Trouble understanding and relating to situations and to people</li>
			<li>Problems with alcohol or drug use</li>
			<li>Major changes in eating habits</li>
			<li>Sex drive changes</li>
			<li>Excessive anger, hostility or violence</li>
			<li>Suicidal thinking</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Sometimes symptoms of a mental health disorder appear as physical problems, such as stomach pain, back pain, headaches, or other unexplained aches and pains.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="causes" class="col-12">
		<h2>Causes</h2>
		<p>Mental illnesses, in general, are thought to be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Inherited traits. </strong>Mental illness is more common in people whose blood relatives also have a mental illness. Certain genes may increase your risk of developing a mental illness, and your life situation may trigger it.</li>
			<li><strong>Environmental exposures before birth. </strong>Exposure to environmental stressors, inflammatory conditions, toxins, alcohol or drugs while in the womb can sometimes be linked to mental illness.</li>
			<li><strong>Brain chemistry. </strong>Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that carry signals to other parts of your brain and body. When the neural networks involving these chemicals are impaired, the function of nerve receptors and nerve systems change, leading to depression and other emotional disorders.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="complications" class="col-12">
		<h2>Complications</h2>
		<p>Mental illness is a leading cause of disability. Untreated mental illness can cause severe emotional, behavioral and physical health problems. Complications sometimes linked to mental illness include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Unhappiness and decreased enjoyment of life</li>
			<li>Family conflicts</li>
			<li>Relationship difficulties</li>
			<li>Social isolation</li>
			<li>Problems with tobacco, alcohol and other drugs</li>
			<li>Missed work or school, or other problems related to work or school</li>
			<li>Legal and financial problems</li>
			<li>Poverty and homelessness</li>
			<li>Self-harm and harm to others, including suicide or homicide</li>
			<li>Weakened immune system, so your body has a hard time resisting infections</li>
			<li>Heart disease and other medical conditions</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="prevention" class="col-12">
		<h2>Prevention</h2>
		<p>There's no sure way to prevent mental illness. However, if you have a mental illness, taking steps to control stress, to increase your resilience and to boost low self-esteem may help keep your symptoms under control. Follow these steps:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Pay attention to warning signs. </strong>Work with your doctor or therapist to learn what might trigger your symptoms. Make a plan so that you know what to do if symptoms return. Contact your doctor or therapist if you notice any changes in symptoms or how you feel. Consider involving family members or friends to watch for warning signs.</li>
			<li><strong>Get routine medical care. </strong>Don't neglect checkups or skip visits to your primary care provider, especially if you aren't feeling well. You may have a new health problem that needs to be treated, or you may be experiencing side effects of medication.</li>
			<li><strong>Get help when you need it. </strong>Mental health conditions can be harder to treat if you wait until symptoms get bad. Long-term maintenance treatment also may help prevent a relapse of symptoms.</li>
			<li><strong>Take good care of yourself. </strong>Sufficient sleep, healthy eating and regular physical activity are important. Try to maintain a regular schedule. Talk to your primary care provider if you have trouble sleeping or if you have questions about diet and physical activity.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="diagnosis" class="col-12">
		<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
		<p>To determine a diagnosis and check for related complications, you may have:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A physical exam. </strong>Your doctor will try to rule out physical problems that could cause your symptoms.</li>
			<li><strong>Lab tests. </strong>These may include, for example, a check of your thyroid function or a screening for alcohol and drugs.</li>
			<li><strong>A psychological evaluation. </strong>A doctor or mental health professional talks to you about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire to help answer these questions.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</div>
	
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="treatment" class="col-12">
		<h2>Treatment</h2>
		<p>Your treatment depends on the type of mental illness you have, its severity and what works best for you. In many cases, a combination of treatments works best.</p>
		<p>If you have a mild mental illness with well-controlled symptoms, treatment from your primary care provider may be sufficient. However, often a team approach is appropriate to make sure all your psychiatric, medical and social needs are met. This is especially important for severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia.</p>
		<h4>Your treatment team</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Family or primary care doctor</li>
			<li>Nurse practitioner</li>
			<li>Physician assistant</li>
			<li>Psychiatrist, a medical doctor who diagnoses and treats mental illnesses</li>
			<li>Psychotherapist, such as a psychologist or a licensed counselor</li>
			<li>Pharmacist</li>
			<li>Social worker</li>
			<li>Family members</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Medications</h4>
		<p>Although psychiatric medications don't cure mental illness, they can often significantly improve symptoms. Psychiatric medications can also help make other treatments, such as psychotherapy, more effective. The best medications for you will depend on your particular situation and how your body responds to the medication.</p>
		<p>Some of the most commonly used classes of prescription psychiatric medications include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Antidepressants. </strong>Antidepressants are used to treat depression, anxiety and sometimes other conditions. They can help improve symptoms such as sadness, hopelessness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating and lack of interest in activities. Antidepressants are not addictive and do not cause dependency.</li>
			<li><strong>Anti-anxiety medications. </strong>These drugs are used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. They may also help reduce agitation and insomnia. Long-term anti-anxiety drugs typically are antidepressants that also work for anxiety. Fast-acting anti-anxiety drugs help with short-term relief, but they also have the potential to cause dependency, so ideally they'd be used short term.</li>
			<li><strong>Mood-stabilizing medications. </strong>Mood stabilizers are most commonly used to treat bipolar disorders, which involves alternating episodes of mania and depression. Sometimes mood stabilizers are used with antidepressants to treat depression.</li>
			<li><strong>Antipsychotic medications.</strong>Antipsychotic drugs are typically used to treat psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia. Antipsychotic medications may also be used to treat bipolar disorders or used with antidepressants to treat depression.</li>
			<h4>Psychotherapy</h4>
			<p>Psychotherapy, also called talk therapy, involves talking about your condition and related issues with a mental health professional. During psychotherapy, you learn about your condition and your moods, feelings, thoughts and behavior. With the insights and knowledge you gain, you can learn coping and stress management skills.</p>
			<p>There are many types of psychotherapy, each with its own approach to improving your mental well-being. Psychotherapy often can be successfully completed in a few months, but in some cases, long-term treatment may be needed. It can take place one-on-one, in a group or with family members.</p>
			<p>When choosing a therapist, you should feel comfortable and be confident that he or she is capable of listening and hearing what you have to say. Also, it's important that your therapist understands the life journey that has helped shape who you are and how you live in the world.</p>
			<h4>Brain-stimulation treatments</h4>
			<p>Brain-stimulation treatments are sometimes used for depression and other mental health disorders. They're generally reserved for situations in which medications and psychotherapy haven't worked. They include electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation and vagus nerve stimulation.</p>

			<h3>What is Anxiety?</h3>
			<p>Anxiety is a very normal response to stressful life events like moving, changing jobs or having financial troubles.</p>
			<p>However, when symptoms of anxiety become larger than the events that triggered them and begin to interfere with your life, they could be signs of an anxiety disorder.</p>
			<p>Anxiety disorders can be debilitating, but they can be managed with proper help from a medical professional. Recognizing the symptoms is the first step</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Here are 11 common symptoms of an anxiety disorder, as well as how to reduce anxiety naturally and when to seek professional help.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Excessive Worrying</li>
				<li>Feeling Agitated</li>
				<li>Restlessness</li>
				<li>Fatigue</li>
				<li>Difficulty Concentrating</li>
				<li>Irritability</li>
				<li>Sweating</li>
				<li>Trembling</li>
				<li>Tense Muscles</li>
				<li>Trouble Falling or Staying Asleep</li>
				<li>Panic Attacks</li>
				<li>Avoiding Social Situations</li>
				<li>Irrational Fears</li>
				<li>Feeling weak or tired</li>
				<li>Having trouble sleeping</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Types of anxiety disorders</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Agoraphobia </strong>(ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed.</li>
				<li><strong>Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition </strong>includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem.</li>
				<li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder </strong>includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events â€” even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression.</li>
				<li><strong>Panic disorder </strong>involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred.</li>
				<li><strong>Selective mutism </strong>is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning.</li>
				<li><strong>Separation anxiety disorder </strong>is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles</li>
				<li><strong>Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) </strong>involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others.</li>
				<li><strong>Specific phobias </strong>are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people.</li>
				<li><strong>Substance-induced anxiety disorder </strong>is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs.</li>
				<li><strong>Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder </strong>are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>The causes of anxiety disorders aren't fully understood. Life experiences such as traumatic events appear to trigger anxiety disorders in people who are already prone to anxiety. Inherited traits also can be a factor.</p>
			<h4>Medical causes</h4>
			<p>For some people, anxiety may be linked to an underlying health issue. In some cases, anxiety signs and symptoms are the first indicators of a medical illness. If your doctor suspects your anxiety may have a medical cause, he or she may order tests to look for signs of a problem.</p>
			<p>Examples of medical problems that can be linked to anxiety include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Heart disease</li>
				<li>Diabetes</li>
				<li>Thyroid problems, such as hyperthyroidism</li>
				<li>Respiratory disorders, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma</li>
				<li>Drug misuse or withdrawal</li>
				<li>Withdrawal from alcohol, anti-anxiety medications (benzodiazepines) or other medications</li>
				<li>Chronic pain or irritable bowel syndrome</li>
				<li>Rare tumors that produce certain fight-or-flight hormones</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Sometimes anxiety can be a side effect of certain medications.</p>
			<p>It's possible that your anxiety may be due to an underlying medical condition if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You don't have any blood relatives (such as a parent or sibling) with an anxiety disorder</li>
				<li>You didn't have an anxiety disorder as a child</li>
				<li>You don't avoid certain things or situations because of anxiety</li>
				<li>You have a sudden occurrence of anxiety that seems unrelated to life events and you didn't have a previous history of anxiety</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Having an anxiety disorder does more than make you worry. It can also lead to, or worsen, other mental and physical conditions, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Depression (which often occurs with an anxiety disorder) or other mental health disorders</li>
				<li>Substance misuse</li>
				<li>Trouble sleeping (insomnia)</li>
				<li>Digestive or bowel problems</li>
				<li>Headaches and chronic pain</li>
				<li>Social isolation</li>
				<li>Problems functioning at school or work</li>
				<li>Poor quality of life</li>
				<li>Suicide</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>There's no way to predict for certain what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Get help early. </strong>Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.</li>
				<li><strong>Stay active. </strong>Participate in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. Enjoy social interaction and caring relationships, which can lessen your worries.</li>
				<li><strong>Avoid alcohol or drug use. </strong>Alcohol and drug use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or find a support group to help you.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Natural Ways to Reduce Anxiety</h3>
			<p>There are many natural ways reduce anxiety and help you feel better, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Eating a healthy diet: </strong>Diets rich in vegetables, fruits, high-quality meats, fish, nuts and whole grains can lower the risk of developing anxiety disorders, but diet alone is probably not enough to treat them.</li>
				<li><strong>Consuming probiotics and fermented foods: </strong>Taking probiotics and eating fermented foods have been associated with improved mental health .</li>
				<li><strong>Limiting caffeine: </strong>Excessive caffeine intake may worsen feelings of anxiety in some people, especially those with anxiety disorders.</li>
				<li><strong>Abstaining from alcohol: </strong>Anxiety disorders and alcohol abuse are strongly linked, so it may help to stay away from alcoholic beverages</li>
				<li><strong>Quitting smoking: </strong>Smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder. Quitting is associated with improved mental health</li>
				<li><strong>Exercising often: </strong> Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of developing an anxiety disorder, but research is mixed on whether it helps those who have already been diagnosed.</li>
				<li><strong>Trying meditation: </strong>One type of meditation-based therapy called mindfulness-based stress reduction has been shown to significantly reduce symptoms in people with anxiety disorders.</li>
				<li><strong>Practicing yoga: </strong>Regular yoga practice has been shown to reduce symptoms in people diagnosed with anxiety disorders, but more high-quality research is needed.</li>

			<h3>What is Dissociative disorder?</h3>
			<p>Dissociative disorders are mental disorders that involve experiencing a disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions and identity. People with dissociative disorders escape reality in ways that are involuntary and unhealthy and cause problems with functioning in everyday life.</p>
			<p>Dissociative disorders usually develop as a reaction to trauma and help keep difficult memories at bay. Symptoms â€” ranging from amnesia to alternate identities â€” depend in part on the type of dissociative disorder you have. Times of stress can temporarily worsen symptoms, making them more obvious.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Signs and symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorders you have, but may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Memory loss (amnesia) of certain time periods, events, people and personal information</li>
				<li>A sense of being detached from yourself and your emotions</li>
				<li>A perception of the people and things around you as distorted and unreal</li>
				<li>A blurred sense of identity</li>
				<li>Significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life</li>
				<li>Inability to cope well with emotional or professional stress</li>
				<li>Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Types of dissociative disorders</h3>
			<p>There are three major dissociative disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Dissociative amnesia. </strong>The main symptom is memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years.</li>
				<li><strong>Dissociative identity disorder. </strong>Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by "switching" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue.</li>
				<li><strong>Depersonalization-derealization disorder. </strong>This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself â€” observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>Dissociative disorders usually develop as a way to cope with trauma. The disorders most often form in children subjected to long-term physical, sexual or emotional abuse or, less often, a home environment that's frightening or highly unpredictable. The stress of war or natural disasters also can bring on dissociative disorders.</p>
			<p>Personal identity is still forming during childhood. So a child is more able than an adult to step outside of himself or herself and observe trauma as though it's happening to a different person. A child who learns to dissociate in order to endure a traumatic experience may use this coping mechanism in response to stressful situations throughout life.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Children who are physically, emotionally or sexually abused are at increased risk of developing mental health disorders, such as dissociative disorders. If stress or other personal issues are affecting the way you treat your child, seek help.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Talk to a trusted person such as a friend, your doctor or a leader in your faith community.</li>
				<li>Ask for help locating resources such as parenting support groups and family therapists.</li>
				<li>Look for churches and community education programs that offer parenting classes that also may help you learn a healthier parenting style.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If your child has been abused or has experienced another traumatic event, see a doctor immediately. Your doctor can refer you to a mental health professional who can help your child recover and adopt healthy coping skills.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Dissociative disorders treatment may vary based on the type of disorder you have, but generally include psychotherapy and medication.</p>
			<h4>Psychotherapy</h4>
			<p>Psychotherapy is the primary treatment for dissociative disorders. This form of therapy, also known as talk therapy, counseling or psychosocial therapy, involves talking about your disorder and related issues with a mental health professional. Look for a therapist with advanced training or experience in working with people who have experienced trauma</p>
			<p>Your therapist will work to help you understand the cause of your condition and to form new ways of coping with stressful circumstances. Over time, your therapist may help you talk more about the trauma you experienced, but generally only when you have the coping skills and relationship with your therapist to safely have these conversations.</p>
			<h4>Medication</h4>
			<p>Although there are no medications that specifically treat dissociative disorders, your doctor may prescribe antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications or antipsychotic drugs to help control the mental health symptoms associated with dissociative disorders.</p>

			<h3>Types of Eating Disorders</h3>
			<h4>Anorexia nervosa</h4>
			<p>Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa â€” often simply called anorexia â€” is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities.</p>
			<p>When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation.</p>
			<h4>Bulimia nervosa</h4>
			<p>Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa â€” commonly called bulimia â€” is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging.</p>
			<p>During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories.</p>
			<p>If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight.</p>
			<h4>Binge-eating disorder</h4>
			<p>When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full.</p>
			<p>After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing.</p>
			<p>A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese.</p>
			<h4>Rumination disorder</h4>
			<p>Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out.</p>
			<p>The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability.</p>
			<h4>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder</h4>
			<p>This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight.</p>
			<p>The disorder can result in significant weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood, as well as nutritional deficiencies that can cause health problems.</p>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. As with other mental illnesses, there may be many causes, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Genetics and biology. </strong>Certain people may have genes that increase their risk of developing eating disorders. Biological factors, such as changes in brain chemicals, may play a role in eating disorders.</li>
				<li><strong>Psychological and emotional health. </strong>People with eating disorders may have psychological and emotional problems that contribute to the disorder. They may have low self-esteem, perfectionism, impulsive behavior and troubled relationships.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Eating disorders cause a wide variety of complications, some of them life-threatening. The more severe or long lasting the eating disorder, the more likely you are to experience serious complications, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Serious health problems</li>
				<li>Depression and anxiety</li>
				<li>Suicidal thoughts or behavio</li>
				<li>Problems with growth and development</li>
				<li>Social and relationship problems</li>
				<li>Substance use disorders</li>
				<li>Work and school issues</li>
				<li>Death</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Although there's no sure way to prevent eating disorders, here are some strategies to help your child develop healthy-eating behaviors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Avoid dieting around your child. </strong>Family dining habits may influence the relationships children develop with food. Eating meals together gives you an opportunity to teach your child about the pitfalls of dieting and encourages eating a balanced diet in reasonable portions</li>
				<li><strong>Talk to your child. </strong>For example, there are numerous websites that promote dangerous ideas, such as viewing anorexia as a lifestyle choice rather than an eating disorder. It's crucial to correct any misperceptions like this and to talk to your child about the risks of unhealthy eating choices.</li>
				<li><strong>Cultivate and reinforce a healthy body image </strong>in your child, whatever his or her shape or size. Talk to your child about self-image and offer reassurance that body shapes can vary. Avoid criticizing your own body in front of your child. Messages of acceptance and respect can help build healthy self-esteem and resilience that will carry children through the rocky periods of the teen years.</li>
				<li><strong>Enlist the help of your child's doctor. </strong>At well-child visits, doctors may be able to identify early indicators of an eating disorder. They can ask children questions about their eating habits and satisfaction with their appearance during routine medical appointments, for instance. These visits should include checks of height and weight percentiles and body mass index, which can alert you and your child's doctor to any significant changes.</li>
