  <p id="about">Common Illness </p>
  <ul>
	<li>Allergies</li>
	<li>Cold and flu</li>
	<li>Diarrhea</li>
	<li>Mononucleosis</li>
	<li>Stomach Aches</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Allergies</h2>
Allergies are an immune response triggered by allergens, an ordinarily harmful substance.

Causes
People with allergies have especially sensitive immune systems that react when they contact allergens.

Common allergens include:
<ul><li>foods (nuts, eggs, milk, soy, shellfish, wheat)
</li><li>pollen</li>
<li>mold</li>
<li>latex</li>
<li>pet dander</li></ul>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Because there are so many possible causes, the symptoms of allergies vary widely. Airborne allergens, like pollen and pet dander, are likely to cause:

<ul><li>Eye irritation</li>
<li>Runny nose</li>
<li>Stuffy nose</li>
<li>Puffy, watery eyes</li>
<li>Sneezing</li>
<li>Inflamed, itchy nose and throat</li></ul>

In cases of a more extreme response, called anaphylaxis, symptoms are severe and life-threatening.



<h2>Cold and Flu</h2>
<h3>Colds and influenza (flu) are the most common illnesses among college students.</h3>

<h2>Causes</h2>
Both of these illnesses are upper respiratory infections, meaning they involve your nose, throat, and lungs. Viruses cause both colds and flu by increasing inflammation of the membranes in the nose and throat.

Most transmission of these viruses occurs via hand-to-hand contact.

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
Flu symptoms come on suddenly and affect the body all over. Flu symptoms are usually more serious than a cold and include:
<ul>
<li>fever (100° F)</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>more intense pain and fatigue, and</li>
<li>more severe, often dry cough.</li>
When you get the flu, you are also more prone to bronchitis, sinus, and ear infections. 

Cold symptoms mostly affect above the neck and include:
<ul>
<li>a runny or stuffy nose (nasal congestion),</li>
<li>sneezing,</li>
<li>sore through, and</li>
<li>cough. </li></ul>
You may also experience a mild headache, body aches or a low grade fever. Typically, a cold lasts 2-14 days.

<h2>Conjunctivitis (“pink eye“)</h2>
<h3>Causes</h3>
Conjunctivitis, an inflammation of the transparent membrane (conjunctiva) that lines your eyelids and part of your eyeballs, has several possible causes. It could be a bacterial or viral infection, an allergic reaction to pollen or animal dander, or a result of chemical irritants (smoke, chlorine, lens solution, etc.).

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
These symptoms may last a few hours to several weeks: redness, itching, tearing, burning sensation, pus-like discharge and/or crusting of the eyelids. Because conjunctivitis causes inflammation of the small blood vessels in the conjunctiva to become more prominent, the whites of your eyes will appear pink or red. When you wake you are likely to feel that your eyelids are pasted shut, and your vision may not be as clear as usual.



<h2>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PINKEYE MEDICINES?</h2>
Pinkeye (conjunctivitis) can be caused by bacteria, allergies, or viruses. Bacterial conjunctivitis is most often treated with <p>ophthalmic antibiotic eyedrops or ointments such as</p> <ul><li>Bleph (sulfacetamide sodium)</li><li> Moxeza (moxifloxacin)</li> <li>Zymar (gatifloxacin)</li><li>Romycin (erythromycin)</li><li>Polytrim (polymyxin/trimethoprim)</li><li> Ak-Tracin</li><li> Bacticin (bacitracin)</li><li>AK-Poly-Bac</li> <li>Ocumycin</li> <li>Polycin-B</li> <li>Polytracin Ophthalmic</li> <li>Polysporin Ophthalmic (polymyxin-bacitracin)</li><li>Besivance (besifloxacin)</li> <li>Ciloxan (ciprofloxacin)</li> <li>Quixin</li> <li>Iquix (levofloxacin)</li> <li>Ocuflox (ofloxacin)</li> <li> AzaSite (azithromycin).</li></ul>

<p>For allergic conjunctivitis, antihistamines such as </p><ul><li>Patanol Pataday (olopatadine)</li> <li>Lastacaft (alcaftadine)</li> <li>Bepreve (bepotastine)</li><li> Optivar (azelastine HCl)</li> <li>Elestat (epinastine)</li> <li>Ketotifen (ketotifen fumarate) and Emadine (emedastine) or mast cell stabilizers such as</li><li> Opticrom (cromolyn sodium)</li><li> Alocril (nedocromil)</li> <li>Alomide (lodoxamide tromethamine)</li> <li>Alamast (pemirolast)may be prescribed to treat allergy symptoms such as itching of the eye.</li></ul>

<p>Viral conjunctivitis does not usually require specific antiviral treatments, however over-the-counter topical antihistamines and decongestants (Naphcon-A, Ocuhist) may help relieve symptoms.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Diarrhea</h2>
<h3>Causes</h3>
<h4>Bacterial infection, caused by contaminated food or water</h4>
<ul>
<li>Viral infection</li>
<li>Parasites, which can enter the body through food or water</li>
<li>Food intolerance, such as the inability to digest lactose, the sugar in milk</li>
<li>Overuse of alcohol or laxatives</li>
<li>Medication, such as some antibiotics or antacids containing magnesium</li>
<li>Menstrual cramps</li>
<li>Stress or a panic attack</li>
<li>Symptoms</li>
<li>watery, loose stools</li>
<li>frequent bowel movements</li>
<li>cramping or pain in the abdomen, nausea, bloating</li>
<li>possibly fever or bloody stools, depending on the cause</li>
<li>Treatment</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually diarrhea will clear up on its own in a day or two, but a prolonged case may cause complications. The most important concern is dehydration. If you have symptoms of dehydration, a fever above 102° F, bloody stools (black and tarry), severe abdomen or rectum pain, or diarrhea lasting more than 3 days you should consult a physician. Here’s some advice for taking care of diarrhea yourself:
</p>
<p>Avoid foods that are milk-based, greasy, high-fiber, or very sweet because these are likely to aggravate diarrhea.
Avoid caffeine and alcohol.</p>
<p>Do not eat solid food if you have signs of dehydration (thirst, light-headed, dark urine). Instead, drink about 2 cups of clear fluids per hour (if vomiting isn’t present), such as sports drinks and broth. Water alone is not enough because your body needs sodium and sugar to replace what it’s losing.
</p>
<p>Avoid high sugar drinks, like apple juice, grape juice, and soda, which can pull water into the intestine and make the diarrhea persist.
</p>
<p>Don’t drink clear liquids exclusively for more than 24 hours.</p>
<p>Begin eating normal meals within 12 hours, but stick to food that is bland and won’t irritate your intestine. Some doctors suggest the “BRAT“ diet which includes foods that are low in fiber, fat, and sugar. BRAT stands for Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast.
</p>
<p>Use over-the-counter lactobacillus acidophilus capsules or tablets. These bacteria help maintain a healthy intestine, and are found in yogurt with live active cultures.
</p>
<p>Decrease level of exercise until symptoms are gone.
</p>
<p>Over-the-counter drugs, such as Imodium A-D, should only be used if absolutely necessary because it is important to let diarrhea flush out the bacteria or parasite that’s causing the infection.
</p>
