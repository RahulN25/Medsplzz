			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>A genetic disorder is a health problem caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome. It can be caused by a mutation in a single gene (monogenic) or multiple genes (polygenic) or by a chromosomal abnormality. Although polygenic disorders are the most common, the term is mostly used when discussing disorders with a single genetic cause, either in a gene or chromosome. The mutation responsible can occur spontaneously before embryonic development (a de novo mutation), or it can be inherited from two parents who are carriers of a faulty gene (autosomal recessive inheritance) or from a parent with the disorder (autosomal dominant inheritance). Some disorders are caused by a mutation on the X chromosome and have X-linked inheritance. Very few disorders are inherited on the Y chromosome or mitochondrial DNA.</p>
			<p>There are well over 6,000 known genetic disorders, and new genetic disorders are constantly being described in medical literature. Around 1 in 50 people are affected by a known single-gene disorder, while around 1 in 263 are affected by a chromosomal disorder.Around 65% of people have some kind of health problem as a result of congenital genetic mutations.[6] Due to the significantly large number of genetic disorders, approximately 1 in 21 people are affected by a genetic disorder classified as "rare" (usually defined as affecting less than 1 in 2,000 people). Most genetic disorders are rare in themselves.</p>
			<p>Many infectious diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, can be prevented by vaccines. Frequent and thorough hand-washing also helps protect you from most infectious diseases.</p>

	<div id="types" class="col-9">
		<h2>Types of Genetic Diseases</h2>
		<h3>1)&nbsp;Single-gene</h3>
		<p>A single-gene disorder (or monogenic disorder) is the result of a single mutated gene. Single-gene disorders can be passed on to subsequent generations in several ways. Genomic imprinting and uniparental disomy, however, may affect inheritance patterns. The divisions between recessive and dominant types are not "hard and fast", although the divisions between autosomal and X-linked types are (since the latter types are distinguished purely based on the chromosomal location of the gene). For example, the common form of dwarfism, achondroplasia, is typically considered a dominant disorder, but children with two genes for achondroplasia have a severe and usually lethal skeletal disorder, one that achondroplasics could be considered carriers for. Sickle-cell anemia is also considered a recessive condition, but heterozygous carriers have increased resistance to malaria in early childhood, which could be described as a related dominant condition. When a couple where one partner or both are sufferers or carriers of a single-gene disorder wish to have a child, they can do so through in vitro fertilization, which enables preimplantation genetic diagnosis to occur to check whether the embryo has the genetic disorder.</p>
		<p>Most congenital metabolic disorders known as inborn errors of metabolism result from single-gene defects. Many such single-gene defects can decrease the fitness of affected people and are therefore present in the population in lower frequencies compared to what would be expected based on simple probabilistic calculations.</p>
		<h4>Autosomal dominant</h4>
		<p>Only one mutated copy of the gene will be necessary for a person to be affected by an autosomal dominant disorder. Each affected person usually has one affected parent. The chance a child will inherit the mutated gene is 50%. Autosomal dominant conditions sometimes have reduced penetrance, which means although only one mutated copy is needed, not all individuals who inherit that mutation go on to develop the disease. Examples of this type of disorder are Huntington's disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, neurofibromatosis type 2, Marfan syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, hereditary multiple exostoses (a highly penetrant autosomal dominant disorder), tuberous sclerosis, Von Willebrand disease, and acute intermittent porphyria. Birth defects are also called congenital anomalies.</p>
		<h4>Autosomal recessive</h4>
		<p>Two copies of the gene must be mutated for a person to be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder. An affected person usually has unaffected parents who each carry a single copy of the mutated gene and are referred to as genetic carriers. Each parent with a defective gene normally do not have symptoms. Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene have a 25% risk with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. Examples of this type of disorder are albinism, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, Tay–Sachs disease, Niemann–Pick disease, spinal muscular atrophy, and Roberts syndrome. Certain other phenotypes, such as wet versus dry earwax, are also determined in an autosomal recessive fashion. Some autosomal recessive disorders are common because, in the past, carrying one of the faulty genes led to a slight protection against an infectious disease or toxin such as tuberculosis or malaria. Such disorders include cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, phenylketonuria and thalassaemia.</p>
		<h3>1)&nbsp;Multifactorial disorder</h3>
		<p>Genetic disorders may also be complex, multifactorial, or polygenic, meaning they are likely associated with the effects of multiple genes in combination with lifestyles and environmental factors. Multifactorial disorders include heart disease and diabetes. Although complex disorders often cluster in families, they do not have a clear-cut pattern of inheritance. This makes it difficult to determine a person's risk of inheriting or passing on these disorders. Complex disorders are also difficult to study and treat because the specific factors that cause most of these disorders have not yet been identified. Studies that aim to identify the cause of complex disorders can use several methodological approaches to determine genotype–phenotype associations. One method, the genotype-first approach, starts by identifying genetic variants within patients and then determining the associated clinical manifestations. This is opposed to the more traditional phenotype-first approach, and may identify causal factors that have previously been obscured by clinical heterogeneity, penetrance, and expressivity.</p>
		<p>On a pedigree, polygenic diseases do tend to "run in families", but the inheritance does not fit simple patterns as with Mendelian diseases. But this does not mean that the genes cannot eventually be located and studied. There is also a strong environmental component to many of them (e.g., blood pressure).</p>

		<h2>Signs and symptomes</h2>
		<p>The following list includes features that might suggest that your child has a genetic disorder. However, some of these characteristics are commonly found in people without a disorder. You'll want to check with you doctor if your child has at least two of the following features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ear abnormalities</li>
			<li>Unusually shaped eyes</li>
			<li>Different colored eyes</li>
			<li>Facial features that are unusual or different from other family members</li>

		<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
		<p>Due to the wide range of genetic disorders that are known, diagnosis is widely varied and dependent of the disorder. Most genetic disorders are diagnosed at birth or during early childhood however some, such as Huntington's disease, can escape detection until the patient is well into adulthood.</p>
		<p>The basic aspects of a genetic disorder rests on the inheritance of genetic material. With an in depth family history, it is possible to anticipate possible disorders in children which direct medical professionals to specific tests depending on the disorder and allow parents the chance to prepare for potential lifestyle changes, anticipate the possibility of stillbirth, or contemplate termination. Prenatal diagnosis can detect the presence of characteristic abnormalities in fetal development through ultrasound, or detect the presence of characteristic substances via invasive procedures which involve inserting probes or needles into the uterus such as in amniocentesis.</p>

<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="treatment" class="col-9">
		<h2>Treatment</h2>
		<p>The treatment of genetic disorders is an ongoing battle, with over 1,800 gene therapy clinical trials having been completed, are ongoing, or have been approved worldwide. Despite this, most treatment options revolve around treating the symptoms of the disorders in an attempt to improve patient quality of life.</p>
		<p>Gene therapy refers to a form of treatment where a healthy gene is introduced to a patient. This should alleviate the defect caused by a faulty gene or slow the progression of the disease. A major obstacle has been the delivery of genes to the appropriate cell, tissue, and organ affected by the disorder. How does one introduce a gene into the potentially trillions of cells which carry the defective copy? This question has been the roadblock between understanding the genetic disorder and correcting the genetic disorder.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Albnism?</h3>
			<p>Albinism is a congenital disorder characterized in humans by the complete or partial absence of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes. Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as photophobia, nystagmus, and amblyopia. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>People with albinism will have the following symptoms:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>an absence of color in the hair, skin, or eyes</li>
				<li>lighter than normal coloring of the hair, skin, or eyes</li>
				<li>patches of skin that have an absence of color</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Albinism occurs with vision problems, which may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>strabismus (crossed eyes)</li>
				<li>photophobia (sensitivity to light)</li>
				<li>nystagmus (involuntary rapid eye movements)</li>
				<li>impaired vision or blindness</li>
				<li>astigmatism</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Types of albnism</h3>
			<p>Different gene defects characterize the numerous types of albinism. Types of albinism include:</p>
			<h4>Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA)</h4>
			<p>OCA affects the skin, hair, and eyes. There are several subtypes of OCA:</p>
			<h4>Ocular albinism</h4>
			<p>Ocular albinism is the result of a gene mutation on the X chromosome and occurs almost exclusively in males. This type of albinism only affects the eyes. People with this type have normal hair, skin, and eye coloring, but have no coloring in the retina (the back of the eye).</p>
			<h4>Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome</h4>
			<p>This syndrome is a rare form of albinism that’s due to a defect in one of eight genes. It produces symptoms similar to OCA. The syndrome occurs with lung, bowel, and bleeding disorders.</p>
			<h4>Chediak-Higashi syndrome</h4>
			<p>Chediak-Higashi syndrome is another rare form of albinism that’s the result of a defect in the LYST gene. It produces symptoms similar to OCA, but may not affect all areas of the skin. Hair is usually brown or blond with a silvery sheen. The skin is usually creamy white to grayish. People with this syndrome have a defect in the white blood cells, increasing their risk of infections.</p>
			<h4>Griscelli syndrome</h4>
			<p>Griscelli syndrome is an extremely rare genetic disorder. It’s due to a defect in one of three genes. There only have been 60 known casesTrusted Source of this syndrome worldwide since 1978. It occurs with albinism (but may not affect the entire body), immune problems, and neurological problems. Griscelli syndrome usually results in death within the first decade of life.</p>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>A defect in one of several genes that produce or distribute melanin causes albinism. The defect may result in the absence of melanin production, or a reduced amount of melanin production. The defective gene passes down from both parents to the child and leads to albinism.</p>
			<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
			<p>The most accurate way to diagnose albinism is through genetic testing to detect defective genes related to albinism. Less accurate ways of detecting albinism include an evaluation of symptoms by your doctor or an electroretinogram test. This test measures the response of the light-sensitive cells in the eyes to reveal eye problems associated with albinism.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>There’s no cure for albinism. However, treatment can relieve symptoms and prevent sun damage. Treatment may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sunglasses to protect the eyes from the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays</li>
				<li>protective clothing and sunscreen to protect the skin from UV rays</li>
				<li>prescription eyeglasses to correct vision problems</li>
				<li>surgery on the muscles of the eyes to correct abnormal eye movements</li>

			<h3>What is Asthma?</h3>
			<p>Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways to the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities challenging or even impossible.</p>
			<p>Normally, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose or mouth and down into your throat and into your airways, eventually making it to your lungs.</p>
			<p>There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air into your bloodstream.</p>
			<p>Asthma symptoms occur when the lining of your airways swell and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through.</p>
			<p>These conditions can then bring on an asthma “attack,” the coughing and tightness in your chest that’s typical of asthma.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>=The most common symptom of asthma is wheezing, a squealing or whistling sound made when you breathe.</p>
			<p>Other asthma symptoms may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>coughing, especially at night, when laughing, or during exercise</li>
				<li>tightness in the chest</li>
				<li>shortness of breath</li>
				<li>difficulty talking</li>
				<li>anxiousness or panic</li>
				<li>fatigue</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The type of asthma that you have can determine which symptoms you experience.</p>
			<p>In children, severe giardiasis might delay physical and mental growth, slow development, and cause malnutrition.</p>
			<p>Not everyone with asthma will experience these particular symptoms. If you think the symptoms you’re experiencing could be a sign of a condition such as asthma, make an appointment to see your doctor.</p>
			<p>The first indication that you have asthma may not be an actual asthma attack.</p>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>No single cause has been identified for asthma. Instead, researchers believe that the breathing condition is caused by a variety of factors. These factors include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Genetics.</strong> If a parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it.</li>
				<li><strong>History of viral infections.</strong> People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood (e.g. RSV) may be more likely to develop the condition.</li>
				<li><strong>Hygiene hypothesis.</strong> This theory explains that when babies aren’t exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems don’t become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Because researchers have yet to identify the exact cause of asthma, it’s challenging to know how to prevent the inflammatory condition.</p>
			<p>However, more information is known about preventing asthma attacks. These strategies include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Avoiding triggers.</strong> Steer clear of chemicals, smells, or products that have caused breathing problems in the past.</li>
				<li><strong>Reducing exposure to allergens.</strong> If you’ve identified allergens, such as dust or mold, that trigger an asthma attack, avoid them as best you can.</li>
				<li><strong>Getting allergy shots.</strong> Allergen immunotherapy is a type of treatment that may help alter your immune system. With routine shots, your body may become less sensitive to any triggers you encounter.</li>
				<li><strong>Taking preventive medication.</strong>Your doctor may prescribe medication for you to take on a daily basis. This medication may be used in addition to the one you use in case of an emergency.</li>
				<p>Your doctor can help you put an asthma action plan in place so that you know which treatments to use and when.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Treatments for asthma fall into three primary categories:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>breathing exercises</li>
				<li>quick-acting treatments</li>
				<li>long-term asthma control medications</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Your doctor will recommend one treatment or combination of treatments based on:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the type of asthma you have</li>
				<li>your age</li>
				<li>your triggers</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Breathing exercises</h4>
			<p>These exercises can help you get more air into and out of your lungs. Over time, this may help increase lung capacity and cut down on severe asthma symptoms.</p>
			<p>Your doctor or an occupational therapist can help you learn these breathing exercises for asthma.</p>
			<h4>Quick-relief asthma treatments</h4>
			<p>These medications should only be used in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again.</p>
			<h5>Bronchodilators</h5>
			<p>Bronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airwaves. They can be taken as an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer.</p>
			<h4>First aid asthma treatment</h4>
			<p>If you think that someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and assist them in using their rescue inhaler or nebulizer. Two to six puffs of medication should help ease their symptoms.</p>
			<p>If symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes, and a second round of medication doesn’t help, seek emergency medical attention.</p>
			<p>If you frequently need to use quick-relief medications, you should ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control.</p>
			<h4>Long-term asthma control medications</h4>
			<p>These medications, taken daily, help reduce the number and severity of your asthma symptoms, but they don’t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack.</p>
			<p>Long-term asthma control medications include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Anti-inflammatories. </strong>Taken with an inhaler, corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications help reduce swelling and mucus production in your airwaves, making it easier to breathe.</li>
				<li><strong>Anticholinergics. </strong>These help stop your muscles from tightening around your airwaves. They’re usually taken daily in combination with anti-inflammatories.</li>
				<li><strong>Long-acting bronchodilators. </strong>These should only be used in combination with anti-inflammatory asthma medications.</li>
				<li><strong>Biologic therapy drugs. </strong>These new, injectable medications may help people with severe asthma.</li>
				<h4>Bronchial thermoplasty</h4>
				<p>This treatment uses an electrode to heat the airwaves inside the lungs, helping to reduce the size of the muscle and prevent it from tightening.</p>
				<p>Bronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma. It isn’t widely available.</p>

		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Fragile x?</h3>
			<p>Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is an inherited genetic disease passed down from parents to children that causes intellectual and developmental disabilities. It’s also known as Martin-Bell syndrome.</p>
			<p>FXS is the most common hereditary cause of mental disability in boys. It affects 1 in 4,000 boys. It’s less common in girls, affecting about 1 in every 8,000. Boys usually have more severe symptoms than girls.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>FXS can cause learning disabilities, developmental delays, and social or behavioral problems. Disabilities vary in severity. Boys with FXS usually have some level of intellectual disability. Girls may have some intellectual disability or learning disability, or both, but many with fragile X syndrome will have normal intelligence. They might only be diagnosed with FXS if another family member is also diagnosed.</p>
			<p>People with FXS may show a combination of the following symptoms as children and throughout life:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>developmental delays, such as taking longer than normal to sit, walk, or talk compared with other children of the same age</li>
				<li>stuttering</li>
				<li>intellectual and learning disabilities, like having trouble learning new skills</li>
				<li>general or social anxiety</li>
				<li>autism</li>
				<li>impulsiveness</li>
				<li>attention difficulties</li>
				<li>social issues, like not making eye contact with other people, disliking being touched, and trouble understanding body language</li>
				<li>hyperactivity</li>
				<li>seizures</li>
				<li>depression</li>
				<li>difficulty sleeping</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some people with FXS have physical abnormalities. These may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a large forehead or ears, with a prominent jaw</li>
				<li>an elongated face</li>
				<li>protruding ears, forehead, and chin</li>
				<li>loose or flexible joints</li>
				<li>flat feet</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>FXS is caused by a defect in the FMR1 gene located on the X chromosome. The X chromosome is one of two types of sex chromosomes. The other is the Y chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes while men have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.</p>
			<p>The defect, or mutation, on the FMR1 gene prevents the gene from properly making a protein called the fragile X mental retardation 1 protein. This protein plays a role in the functioning of the nervous system. The exact function of the protein is not fully understood. A lack or shortage of this protein causes the symptoms characteristic of FXS.</p>
			<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
			<p>Children who show signs of developmental delays or other outward symptoms of FXS, such as a large head circumference or subtle differences in facial features at a young age, may be tested for FXS. Your child may also be tested if there’s a family history of FXS.</p>
			<p>The average age of diagnosis in boys is 35 to 37 months. In girls, the average age of diagnosis is 41.6 months.</p>
			<p>FXS can be diagnosed using a DNA blood test called the FMR1 DNA test. The test looks for changes in the FMR1 gene that are associated with FXS. Depending on the results, your doctor may choose to do additional testing to determine the severity of the condition.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>FXS cannot be cured. Treatment is aimed at helping people with the condition learn key language and social skills. This may involve receiving extra help from teachers, therapists, family members, doctors, and coaches.</p>
			<p>Medications that are typically prescribed for behavior disorders, like attention deficit disorder (ADD) or anxiety, may be prescribed to treat the symptoms of FXS. Medications include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>methylphenidate (Ritalin)</li>
				<li>guanfacine (Intuniv)</li>
				<li>clonidine (Catapres)</li>
				<li>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), such as sertraline (Zoloft), escitalopram (Lexapro), duloxetine (Cymbalta), and paroxetine (Pail, Pexeva)</li>

			<h3>What is Hemophilia?</h3>
			<p>Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder in which a person lacks or has low levels of certain proteins called “clotting factors” and the blood doesn’t clot properly as a result. This leads to excessive bleeding. There are 13 types of clotting factors, and these work with platelets to help the blood clot. Platelets are small blood cells that form in your bone marrow. According to the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH), about one in 10,000 people are born with this disease.</p>
			<p>People with hemophilia bleed easily, and the blood takes a longer time to clot. People with hemophilia can experience spontaneous or internal bleeding and often have painful, swollen joints due to bleeding into the joints. This rare but serious condition can have life-threatening complications.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>The extent of your symptoms depends on the severity of your factor deficiency. People with a mild deficiency may bleed in the case of trauma. People with a severe deficiency may bleed for no reason. This is called “spontaneous bleeding.” In children with hemophilia, these symptoms may occur around age 2.</p>
			<p>Spontaneous bleeding can cause the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>blood in the urine</li>
				<li>blood in the stool</li>
				<li>deep bruises</li>
				<li>large, unexplained bruises</li>
				<li>excessive bleeding</li>
				<li>bleeding gums</li>
				<li>frequent nosebleeds</li>
				<li>pain in the joints</li>
				<li>tight joints</li>
				<li>irritability (in children)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>A process in your body that’s known as “the coagulation cascade” normally stops bleeding. Blood platelets coagulate, or gather together at the wound site, to form a clot. Then the body’s clotting factors work together to create a more permanent plug in the wound. A low level of these clotting factors or the absence of them causes bleeding to continue.</p>
			<h4>Hemophilia and Genetics</h4>
			<p>Hemophilia is an inherited genetic condition, meaning it is passed down through families. It’s caused by a defect in the gene that determines how the body makes factors VIII, IX, or XI. These genes are located on the X chromosome, making hemophilia an X-linked recessive disease.</p>
			<p>Each person inherits two sex chromosomes from their parents. Females have two X chromosomes. Males have one X and one Y chromosome.</p>
			<p>Males inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father. Females receive an X chromosome from each parent. Because the genetic defect that causes hemophilia is located on the X chromosome, fathers can’t pass the disease to their sons. This also means that if a male gets the X chromosome with the altered gene from his mother, he’ll have hemophilia. A female with one X chromosome that has the altered gene has a 50 percent chance of passing that gene to her children, male or female.</p>
			<p>A female who has the altered gene on one of her X chromosomes is typically called a “carrier.” This means she may pass the disease to her children but she doesn’t have the disease herself. This is because she has sufficient clotting factors from her normal X chromosome to avoid serious bleeding issues. However, females who are carriers often have an increased risk of bleeding.</p>
			<p>Males with an X chromosome that has the altered gene may pass it on to their daughters, making them carriers. A female must have this altered gene on both of her X chromosomes to have hemophilia. However, this is very rare.</p>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>The complications of hemophilia include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>joint damage from repetitive bleeding</li>
				<li>deep internal bleeding</li>
				<li>neurological symptoms from bleeding within the brain</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You’re also at an increased risk of developing infections, such as hepatitis, when you receive donor blood.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Hemophilia is a condition that’s passed from a mother to her child. When you’re pregnant, there’s no way of knowing whether your baby has the condition. However, if your eggs are fertilized in a clinic using in vitro fertilization, they can be tested for the condition. Then, only the eggs without hemophilia can be implanted. Preconception and prenatal counseling can also help you understand your risk of having a baby with hemophilia.</p>
			<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
			<p>Hemophilia is diagnosed through a blood test. Your doctor will remove a small sample of blood from your vein and measure the amount of clotting factor present. The sample is then graded to determine the severity of the factor deficiency:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mild hemophilia is indicated by a clotting factor in the plasma that’s between 5 and 40 percent.</li>
				<li>Moderate hemophilia is indicated by a clotting factor in the plasma that’s between 1 and 5 percent.</li>
				<li>Severe hemophilia is indicated by a clotting factor in the plasma of less than 1 percent.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Your doctor can treat hemophilia A with a prescription hormone. This hormone is called desmopressin, which they can give as an injection into your vein. This medication works by stimulating the factors responsible for the process of blood clotting.</p>
			<p>Your doctor can treat hemophilia B by infusing your blood with donor clotting factors. Sometimes, the factors may be given in the synthetic form. These are called “recombinant clotting factors.”</p>
			<p>Your doctor can treat hemophilia C using plasma infusion. The infusion works to stop profuse bleeding. The deficient factor responsible for hemophilia C is only available as a medication in Europe.</p>
			<p>You can also go to physical therapy for rehabilitation if your joints are damaged by hemophilia.</p>

			<h3>What is Diabetes?</h3>
			<p>Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as diabetes, is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. With diabetes, your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it does make.</p>
			<p>Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Types of diabetes</h3>
			<p>There are a few different types of diabetes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Type 1 diabetes</strong> is an autoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in the pancreas, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack. About 10 percent of people with diabetes have this type</li>
				<li><strong>Type 2 diabetes</strong> occurs when your body becomes resistant to insulin, and sugar builds up in your blood.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar.</p>
			<h4>General symptomes</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>increased hunger</li>
				<li>increased thirst</li>
				<li>frequent urination</li>
				<li>blurry vision</li>
				<li>extreme fatigue</li>
				<li>sores that don’t heal</li>
				<li>weight loss</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Symptoms in men</h4>
			<p>In addition to the general symptoms of diabetes, men with diabetes may have a decreased sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED), and poor muscle strength.</p>
			<h4>Symptoms in women</h4>
			<p>Women with diabetes can also have symptoms such as urinary tract infections, yeast infections, and dry, itchy skin.</p>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>Different causes are associated with each type of diabetes.</p>
			<h4>Type 1 diabetes</h4>
			<p>Doctors don’t know exactly what causes type 1 diabetes. For some reason, the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.</p>
			<p>Genes may play a role in some people. It’s also possible that a virus sets off the immune system attack.</p>
			<h4>Type 2 diabetes</h4>
			<p>Type 2 diabetes stems from a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors. Being overweight or obese increases your risk too. Carrying extra weight, especially in your belly, makes your cells more resistant to the effects of insulin on your blood sugar.</p>
			<p>This condition runs in families. Family members share genes that make them more likely to get type 2 diabetes and to be overweight.</p>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar is and the longer you live with it, the greater your risk for complications.</p>
			<p>Complications associated with diabetes include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>heart disease, heart attack, and stroke</li>
				<li>neuropathy</li>
				<li>nephropathy</li>
				<li>retinopathy and vision loss</li>
				<li>hearing loss</li>
				<li>foot damage such as infections and sores that don’t heal</li>
				<li>skin conditions such as bacterial and fungal infections</li>
				<li>depression</li>
				<li>dementia</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Type 1 diabetes isn’t preventable because it’s caused by a problem with the immune system. Some causes of type 2 diabetes, such as your genes or age, aren’t under your control either.</p>
			<p>Yet many other diabetes risk factors are controllable. Most diabetes prevention strategies involve making simple adjustments to your diet and fitness routine.</p>
			<p>If you’ve been diagnosed with prediabetes, here are a few things you can do to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Get at least 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise, such as walking or cycling.</li>
				<li>Cut saturated and trans fats, along with refined carbohydrates, out of your diet.</li>
				<li>Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li>
				<li>Eat smaller portions.</li>
				<li>Try to lose 7 percentTrusted Source of your body weight if you’re overweight or obese.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Doctors treat diabetes with a few different medications. Some of these drugs are taken by mouth, while others are available as injections.</p>
			<h4>Type 1 diabetes</h4>
			<p>Insulin is the main treatment for type 1 diabetes. It replaces the hormone your body isn’t able to produce.</p>
			<p>There are four types of insulin that are most commonly used. They’re differentiated by how quickly they start to work, and how long their effects last:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 3 to 4 hours.</li>
				<li>Short-acting insulin starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 6 to 8 hours.</li>
				<li>Intermediate-acting insulin starts to work within 1 to 2 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours.</li>
				<li>Long-acting insulin starts to work a few hours after injection and lasts 24 hours or longer.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Type 2 diabetes</h4>
			<p>Diet and exercise can help some people manage type 2 diabetes. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough to lower your blood sugar, you’ll need to take medication.</p>
			<p>These drugs lower your blood sugar in a variety of ways:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Acarbose (Precose) and miglitol (Glyset) </strong>Slow your body’s breakdown of sugars and starchy foods</li>
				<li><strong>Metformin (Glucophage) </strong>	Reduce the amount of glucose your liver makes</li>
				<li><strong>Linagliptin (Tradjenta), saxagliptin (Onglyza), and sitagliptin (Januvia)</strong> Improve your blood sugar without making it drop too low</li>
				<li><strong>Dulaglutide (Trulicity), exenatide (Byetta), and liraglutide (Victoza) </strong>Change the way your body produces insulin</li>
				<li><strong>Nateglinide (Starlix) and repaglinide (Prandin)</strong> Stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin</li>
				<li><strong>Canagliflozin (Invokana) and dapagliflozin (Farxiga)</strong> Release more glucose into the urine</li>
			</ul>
