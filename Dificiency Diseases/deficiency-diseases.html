			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>The body requires many different vitamins and minerals that are crucial for both body development and preventing disease. These vitamins and minerals are often referred to as micronutrients. They aren’t produced naturally in the body, so you have to get them from your diet.</p>
			<p>A nutritional deficiency occurs when the body doesn’t absorb or get from food the necessary amount of a nutrient. Deficiencies can lead to a variety of health problems. These can include digestion problems, skin disorders, stunted or defective bone growth, and even dementia.</p>
			<p>The amount of each nutrient you should consume depends on your age. In the United States, many foods that you buy in the grocery store — such as cereals, bread, and milk — are fortified with nutrients that are needed to prevent nutritional deficiency.</p>
			<p>But sometimes your body is unable to absorb certain nutrients even if you’re consuming them. It’s possible to be deficient in any of the nutrients your body needs.</p>
			<p>Keep reading to learn about some common nutritional deficiencies and how to avoid them.</p>

<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="symptomes" class="col-9">
		<h2>Symptomes</h2>
		<p>The symptoms of a nutritional deficiency depend on which nutrient the body lacks. However, there are some general symptoms you might experience. These can include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>pallor, or pale skin</li>
			<li>fatigue</li>
			<li>weakness</li>
			<li>trouble breathing</li>
			<li>unusual food cravings</li>
			<li>hair loss</li>
			<li>periods of lightheadedness</li>
			<li>constipation</li>
			<li>sleepiness</li>
			<li>heart palpitation</li>
			<li>feeling faint or fainting</li>
			<li>depression</li>
			<li>tingling and numbness of the joints</li>
			<li>menstrual issues, such as missed periods or very heavy cycles</li>
			<li>poor concentration</li>
		</ul>
		<p>You may display all of these symptoms or only groups of them.</p>
		<p>Over time, most people adapt to the symptoms. This can cause the condition to go undiagnosed. Schedule a checkup with your doctor if you experience prolonged periods of fatigue, weakness, or poor concentration. These symptoms could be a sign of the beginning of a serious deficiency.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="causes" class="col-9">
		<h2>Causes</h2>
		<p>The main causes of nutritional deficiencies include a poor diet that lacks essential nutrients, a disease or medication that impairs absorption, or both. The body is able to store some nutrients, so a deficiency may not be caught until the body has been without the nutrient for some time.</p>
		<p>A number of diseases and conditions can lead to an iron deficiency. These include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>colon cancer</li>
			<li>imbalanced gut flora</li>
			<li>Crohn's disease</li>
			<li>celia disease</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Pregnancy can also cause an iron deficiency if the body diverts iron to the fetus.</p>
		<p>Researchers have found associations between bariatric surgery, which reduces the size of the stomach to achieve weight loss, and nutritional deficiency.</p>
		<p>People who are candidates for bariatric surgery may already be nutrient-deficient due to poor diet. Talk to your doctor and dietitian before and after the surgery to set up a thorough nutrition plan.</p>
	</div>
</div>	
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="diagnosis" class="col-9">
		<h2>Diagnosis</h2>
		<p>The treatment for a nutritional deficiency depends on the type and severity of the deficiency. Your doctor will find out how severe the deficiency is as well as the likelihood of long-term problems caused by the lack of nutrients.</p>
		<p>Before deciding on a treatment plan, they may order further testing to see if there’s any other damage. Symptoms usually fade when the correct diet is followed or nutrient is supplemented.</p>
	</div>
</div>
	
<div class="container-fluid padding">
	<div id="prevention" class="col-9">
		<h2>Prevention</h2>
		<p>We all know that a proper diet and regular exercise are important for optimal health, but if you're leaving out key ingredients in your foods, like magnesium or iron, you might be suffering from a nutritional deficiency. Increasing your intake of such vitamins and minerals can be a tall order, but you can start by consuming more fruits, vegetables and high-quality, plant-derived supplements. </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<h5>Add fiber especially soluable fiber</h5>
				<p>Most of us are deficeint in fiber-the essence of fruits, veggies, nuts and beans. Fiber not only tames the insulin spike that results form excessive sugar consumption, but also lowers your risk of developing type-2 diabeties</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Get adequete vitamin-D</h5>
				<p>Most of us are deficient in vitamin-D, a serious problem that could compromise our immunity. Vitamin-D comes in two forms D2 and D3. D2 comes from plant foods and D3 comes from animal foods. such as fish, eggs and liver. Your body also produces D3 when you expose your skin to big dose of sunshine.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Eat healthy fats and Omega-3 fats</h5>
				<p>The food industry has deceived many of us into thinking refined junk oils from genetically modeified plants lik corn canola qualify as "healthy". Nope Instead get healthy omega-3 fats from fish, flax seed or flax oil, olive oil, coconut oil, avocado, nuts and seeds. Eating this daily lowers inflammation, depression and heart-threating triglycerides, and supports brain health.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Boost antioxidants</h5>
				<p>These healthy cell protectors and cancer cell blokers comes mostly from plants like lighty colored berries, legumes, dark green like kale, sweet potatoes and dark grapes like the one in wine. In general any fruit and vegetable with deep color likely to boost antioxidants among their benefits.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Eat lean and plant based proteins</h5>
				<p>Some of the best protein sources come from plants. such as legumes, seeds, nuts and whole grains. Also consider seafood like small mouth, wild caught fish and lean,protein rich, animal based proteins, such as eggs and yoghurt.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Eat calcium rich foods</h5>
				<p>In adddition to milk and yoghurt, other food rich in calcium includes leafy greens like kale and spinach, some fruits and seafood like sardines.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h5>Consume cruciferous vegetabe</h5>
				<p>Cruciferous vegetables have it all: fiber, phytochemicaks, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants.</p>
			</li>

		<h2>Treatment</h2>
		<p>The treatment for a nutritional deficiency depends on the type and severity of the deficiency. Your doctor will find out how severe the deficiency is as well as the likelihood of long-term problems caused by the lack of nutrients.</p>
		<p>Before deciding on a treatment plan, they may order further testing to see if there’s any other damage. Symptoms usually fade when the correct diet is followed or nutrient is supplemented.</p>
		<h4>Dietary Changes</h4>
		<p>A doctor may advise you on how to change your eating habits in the case of a minor deficiency. For example, people with iron deficiency anemia should include more meat, eggs, dark meat poultry, vegetables, and legumes in their diet.</p>
		<p>Your doctor may refer you to a dietitian if your deficiency is more severe. They may recommend keeping a food diary for a few weeks. When you meet with the dietitian, you’ll go over the diary and identify any changes you should make.</p>
		<p>Typically, you’ll meet with your dietitian regularly. Eventually, you may have a blood test to confirm that you’re no longer deficient.</p>
		<h4>Supplements</h4>
		<p>You get most of your nutrients from food. In some cases, you may need to take supplements or a multivitamin. It may also be necessary to take an additional supplement to help your body absorb the supplements, such as taking calcium and vitamin D together.</p>
		<p>The frequency and dosage of a supplement depends on how severe the deficiency is. Your doctor or dietitian can determine this. Talk to your doctor before taking any nutritional supplements.</p>
		<h4>Parental administration</h4>
		<p>In very severe cases — such as when a nutritional deficiency doesn’t respond to oral medications or vitamins — it may be necessary to give the nutrient parenterally, or through the veins or muscles. This can carry the risk of additional side effects. It’s usually done in a hospital.</p>
		<p>Parenteral iron, for example, can cause side effects that include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>chills</li>
			<li>backaches</li>
			<li>dizzines</li>
			<li>fever</li>
			<li>muscle pain</li>
			<li>fainting</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In rare cases, it can even cause a severe allergic reaction.</p>
		<p>Once you’ve been given the treatment, your doctor will have you do a repeat blood test to confirm that it was successful. You may need to attend the hospital for repeat appointments until you’re no longer deficient.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Nightblindness</h3>
			<p>Night blindness is a type of vision impairment also known as nyctalopia. People with night blindness experience poor vision at night or in dimly lit environments.</p>
			<p>Although the term “night blindness” implies that you can’t see at night, this isn’t the case. You may just have more difficulty seeing or driving in darkness.</p>
			<p>Some types of night blindness are treatable while other types aren’t. See your doctor to determine the underlying cause of your vision impairment. Once you know the cause of the problem, you can take steps to correct your vision.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Night blindness is a symptom of an underlying eye condition that results in vision impairment while in dim lighting.</p>
			<p>For example, night blindness could prevent someone from being able to see stars at night, or obstacles in a dark room.</p>
			<p>To identify night blindness, consider the following questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>is moving around the house in dim light a challenge?</li>
				<li>Is driving at night increasingly difficult?</li>
				<li>Is it tricky to recognize faces in dim light?</li>
				<li>Does it take an abnormally long time to adjust to a light room after being in the dark?</li>
				<li>Does it take a long time to see in a darkened room after being in the light?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other symptoms may also occur with night blindness. The nature of these symptoms will depend on the underlying cause but may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>headaches</li>
				<li>eye pain</li>
				<li>nausea</li>
				<li>vomiting</li>
				<li>blurry or cloudy vision</li>
				<li>sensitivity to light</li>
				<li>difficulty seeing into the distance</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>Night blindness is the result of one of several conditions, many of which are treatable. Conditions can include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Glaucoma</h4>
					<p>Glaucoma refers to a group of eye conditions where damage to the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain, causes pressure in the eye. This may impair vision, which can be permanent</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Cataracts</h4>
					<p>Cataracts occur when the lens of the eye becomes cloudy. This often happens when proteins in the lens break down, usually due to aging. Clouding of the lens can impair vision, including in dim lighting.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Nearsightedness</h4>
					<p>People with nearsightedness, which doctors call myopia, are unable to see objects in the distance accurately. This occurs when the eye grows too long and no longer focuses light correctly.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Vitamin A deficiency</h4>
					<p>Vitamin A, or retinol, is an essential nutrient for vision. For example, it makes up a protein that absorbs light in the retina and supports eye functioning. Vitamin A deficiencies can have a serious impact on vision.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Retinitis pigmentosa</h4>
					<p>This is a group of rare eye diseases that damage the retina. It is a genetic disorder that results in difficulty seeing in low light.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>Eat foods rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, which may help prevent cataracts. Also, choose foods that contain high levels of vitamin A to reduce your risk of night blindness.</p>
			<p>Certain orange-colored foods are excellent sources of vitamin A, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>cantaloupes</li>
				<li>sweet potatoes</li>
				<li>carrots</li>
				<li>pumpkins</li>
				<li>butternut squash</li>
				<li>mangoes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Vitamin A is also in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>spinach</li>
				<li>collard greens</li>
				<li>milk</li>
				<li>eggs</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Treatment may include wearing specific types of glasses or contact lenses, which can help to support correct vision.Wearing sunglasses can also protect the eye from ultraviolet light, which can cause further eye damage.</p>
			<p>When the cause is a lack of vitamin A, treatment involves adding more Vitamin A to the diet. Good sources of vitamin A include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>eggs</li>
				<li>fortified cereals</li>
				<li>fortified milk</li>
				<li>orange and yellow vegetables and fruits</li>
				<li>cod liver oil</li>
				<li>dark, leafy green vegetables</li>

			<img src="PE_Blog21.png" class="img-fluid">
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12 col-lg-6 padding">
			<h3>What is Anemia</h3>
			<p>Anemia occurs when you have a decreased level of hemoglobin in your red blood cells (RBCs). Hemoglobin is the protein in your RBCs that is responsible for carrying oxygen to your tissues</p>
			<p>Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia, and it occurs when your body doesn’t have enough of the mineral iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. When there isn’t enough iron in your blood stream, the rest of your body can’t get the amount of oxygen it needs.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>The symptoms of iron deficiency anemia can be mild at first, and you may not even notice them. According to the American Society of Hematology (ASH), most people don’t realize they have mild anemia until they have a routine blood test.</p>
			<p>The symptoms of moderate to severe iron deficiency anemia include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fatigue</li>
				<li>weakness</li>
				<li>pale skin</li>
				<li>shortness of breath</li>
				<li>dizziness</li>
				<li>strange cravings to eat items that aren’t food, such as dirt, ice, or clay</li>
				<li>a tingling or crawling feeling in the legs</li>
				<li>tongue swelling or soreness</li>
				<li>cold hands and feet</li>
				<li>fast or irregular heartbeat</li>
				<li>brittle nails</li>
				<li>headaches</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Complications</h3>
			<p>Most cases of iron deficiency anemia are mild and don’t cause complications. The condition can usually be corrected easily. However, if anemia or iron deficiency is left untreated, it can lead to other health problems. These include:.</p>
			<h4>Rapid or irregular heartbeat</h4>
			<p>When you’re anemic, your heart has to pump more blood to make up for the low amount of oxygen. This can lead to irregular heartbeat. In severe cases, it can lead to heart failure or an enlarged heart.</p>
			<h4>Pregnancy complications</h4>
			<p>In severe cases of iron deficiency, a child may be born prematurely or with a low birth weight. Most pregnant women take iron supplements as part of their prenatal care to prevent this from happening.</p>
			<h4>Delayed growth in infants and children</h4>
			<p>Infants and children who are severely deficient in iron may experience delayed growth and development. They may also be more prone to infections.</p>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>There are many reasons why a person might become deficient in iron. These include:</p>
			<h4>Inadequate iron intake</h4>
			<p>Eating too little iron over an extended amount of time can cause a shortage in your body. Foods such as meat, eggs, and some green leafy vegetables are high in iron. Because iron is essential during times of rapid growth and development, pregnant women and young children may need even more iron-rich foods in their diet.</p>
			<h4>Pregnancy or blood loss due to menstruation</h4>
			<p>Heavy menstrual bleeding and blood loss during childbirth are the most common causes of iron deficiency anemia in women of childbearing age.</p>
			<h5>Internal bleeding</h5>
			<p>Certain medical conditions can cause internal bleeding, which can lead to iron deficiency anemia. Examples include an ulcer in your stomach, polyps in the colon or intestines, or colon cancer. Regular use of pain relievers, such as aspirin, can also cause bleeding in the stomach.</p>
			<h4>Inability to absorb iron</h4>
			<p>Certain disorders or surgeries that affect the intestines can also interfere with how your body absorbs iron. Even if you get enough iron in your diet, celiac disease or intestinal surgery such as gastric bypass may limit the amount of iron your body can absorb.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>When caused by inadequate iron intake, iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by eating a diet high in iron-rich foods and vitamin C. Mothers should make sure to feed their babies breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula.</p>
			<p>Foods high in iron include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>meat, such as lamb, pork, chicken, and beef</li>
				<li>beans</li>
				<li>pumpkin and squash seeds</li>
				<li>leafy greens, such as spinach</li>
				<li>raisins and other dried fruit</li>
				<li>eggs</li>
				<li>seafood, such as clams, sardines, shrimp, and oysters</li>
				<li>ron-fortified dry and instant cereals</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Foods high in vitamin C include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, kiwis, guavas, papayas, pineapples, melons, and mangoes</li>
				<li>broccoli</li>
				<li>red and green bell peppers</li>
				<li>Brussels sprouts</li>
				<li>cauliflower</li>
				<li>tomatoes</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<h4>Iron supplements</h4>
			<p>Iron tablets can help restore iron levels in your body. If possible, you should take iron tablets on an empty stomach, which helps the body absorb them better. If they upset your stomach, you can take them with meals. You may need to take the supplements for several months. Iron supplements may cause constipation or black stools.</p>
			<h4>Diet</h4>
			<p>Diets that include the following foods can help treat or prevent iron deficiency:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>red meat</li>
				<li>dark green, leafy vegetables</li>
				<li>dried fruits</li>
				<li>nuts</li>
				<li>iron-fortified cereals</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. If you’re taking iron tablets, a doctor might suggest taking the tablets along with a source of vitamin C, such as a glass of orange juice or citrus fruit.</p>
			<h4>Treating the underlying cause of bleeding</h4>
			<p>Iron supplements won’t help if excess bleeding causes the deficiency. A doctor may prescribe birth control pills to women who have heavy periods. This can reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding each month.</p>
			<p>In the most severe cases, a blood transfusion can replace iron and blood loss quickly.</p>

			<h3>What is Scurvy?</h3>
			<p>A condition caused by a severe lack of vitamin C in the diet.</p>
			<p>Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits and vegetables. Scurvy results from a deficiency of vitamin C in the diet.Symptoms may not occur for a few months after a person's dietary intake of vitamin C drops too low. Bruising, bleeding gums, weakness, fatigue and rash are among scurvy symptoms.Treatment involves taking vitamin C supplements and eating citrus fruits, potatoes, broccoli and strawberries.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Vitamin C plays many different roles in the body. A deficiency in the vitamin causes widespread symptoms.</p>
			<p>Typically signs of scurvy begin after at least four weeks of severe, continual vitamin C deficiency. Generally, however, it takes three months or more for symptoms to develop.</p>
			<h4>Early warning signs</h4>
			<p>Early warning signs and symptoms of scurvy include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>weakness</li>
				<li>unexplained exhaustion</li>
				<li>reduced appetite</li>
				<li>irritability</li>
				<li>aching legs</li>
				<li>low-grade fever</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Symptoms after one to three months</h4>
			<p>Common symptoms of untreated scurvy after one to three months include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>anemia, when the blood lacks enough red blood cells or hemoglobin</li>
				<li>gingivitis, or red, soft, and tender gums that bleed easily</li>
				<li>skin hemorrhages, or bleeding under the skin</li>
				<li>bruise-like raised bumps at hair follicles, often on the shins, with central hairs that appear corkscrewed, or twisted, and break easily</li>

			<p>Though the symptoms can be severe, scurvy is fairly simple to treat.</p>
			<p>Vitamin C is naturally found in many fruits and vegetables. It’s also often added to juices, cereals, and snack foods. If you suspect you have a mild case of scurvy, eating at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily is the easiest way to treat the condition.</p>
			<p>Oral vitamin C supplements are also widely available and the vitamin is included in most multivitamins. If symptoms continue after a few days of dietary changes, talk with a doctor.</p>
			<p>For severe, chronic, cases of scurvy, a doctor may recommend high-doses of oral vitamin C supplements for several weeks to months. There’s no consensus on a specific therapeutic dose for severe scurvy. For these cases, a doctor may recommend high doses of oral vitamin C supplements for several weeks or longer.</p>

			<h3>What is Rickets?</h3>
			<p>Rickets is a skeletal disorder that’s caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. These nutrients are important for the development of strong, healthy bones. People with rickets may have weak and soft bones, stunted growth, and, in severe cases, skeletal deformities.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>Symptoms of rickets include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>pain or tenderness in the bones of the arms, legs, pelvis, or spine</li>
				<li>stunted growth and short stature</li>
				<li>bone fractures</li>
				<li>muscle cramps</li>
				<li>teeth deformities</li>
				<li>skeletal deformities, including</li>
					<ul>
						<li>an oddly shaped skull</li>
						<li>bowlegs, or legs that bow out</li>
						<li>bumps in the ribcage</li>
						<li>a protruding breastbone</li>
						<li>a curved spine</li>
						<li>pelvic deformities</li>
					</ul>
			</ul>
			<p>Call your doctor right away if your child is showing signs of rickets. If the disorder isn’t treated during a child’s growth period, the child may end up with a very short stature as an adult. Deformities can also become permanent if the disorder goes untreated.</p>
			<h3>Who is at risk for developing rickets?</h3>
			<h4>Age</h4>
			<p>Rickets is most common in children who are between 6 and 36 months old. During this time period, children usually experience rapid growth. This is when their bodies need the most calcium and phosphate to strengthen and develop their bones.</p>
			<h4>Diet</h4>
			<p>You have a higher risk of developing rickets if you eat a vegetarian diet that doesn’t include fish, eggs, or milk. You’re also at an increased risk if you have trouble digesting milk or have an allergy to milk sugar (lactose). Infants who are only fed breast milk can become deficient in vitamin D as well. Breast milk doesn’t contain enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.</p>
			<h4>Skin color</h4>
			<p>Children of African, Pacific Islander, and Middle Eastern descent are at the highest risk for rickets because they have dark skin. Dark skin doesn’t react as strongly to sunlight as lighter skin does, so it produces less vitamin D.</p>
			<h4>Geographic location</h4>
			<p>Our bodies produce more vitamin D when they’re exposed to sunshine, so you’re more at risk for rickets if you live in an area with little sunlight. You’re also at a higher risk if you work indoors during daylight hours.</p>
			<h4>Genes</h4>
			<p>One form of rickets can be inherited. This means that the disorder is passed down through your genes. This type of rickets, called hereditary rickets, prevents your kidneys from absorbing phosphate.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>The best way to prevent rickets is to eat a diet that includes adequate amounts of calcium, phosphorous, and vitamin D. People with kidney disorders should have their calcium and phosphate levels monitored on a regular basis by their doctors.</p>
			<p>Rickets can also be prevented with moderate sun exposure. According to the National Health Service of England (NHS), you only need to expose your hands and face to sunlight a few times a week during the spring and summer months to prevent rickets.</p>
			<p>Most adults get enough exposure to sunlight. It’s important to note that too much sunlight can damage your skin, and sunscreen should be applied to prevent burns and skin damage. Sometimes, the use of sunscreen can prevent your skin from producing vitamin D, so it’s beneficial to eat foods that contain vitamin D or to take vitamin D supplements. These preventive measures can significantly lower your risk of developing rickets.</p>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Increasing vitamin D, calcium, and phosphate levels will help correct the disorder. Most children with rickets see improvements in about one week.</p>
			<p>Skeletal deformities will often improve or disappear over time if rickets is corrected while the child is still young. However, skeletal deformities can become permanent if the disorder isn’t treated during a child’s growth period.</p>

			<h3>What is Beriberi?</h3>
			<p>Beriberi is a disease caused by a vitamin B-1 deficiency, also known as thiamine deficiency. There are two types of the disease: wet beriberi and dry beriberi. Wet beriberi affects the heart and circulatory system. In extreme cases, wet beriberi can cause heart failure. Dry beriberi damages the nerves and can lead to decreased muscle strength and eventually, muscle paralysis. Beriberi can be life-threatening if it isn’t treated.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-9 padding">
			<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>
			<p>The symptoms of beriberi vary depending on the type.</p>
			<p>Wet beriberi symptoms include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>shortness of breath during physical activity</li>
				<li>waking up short of breath</li>
				<li>rapid heart rate</li>
				<li>swollen lower legs</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Dry beriberi symptoms include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>decreased muscle function, particularly in the lower legs</li>
				<li>tingling or loss of feeling in the feet and hands</li>
				<li>pain</li>
				<li>mental confusion</li>
				<li>difficulty speaking</li>
				<li>vomiting</li>
				<li>involuntary eye movement</li>
				<li>paralysis</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In extreme cases, beriberi is associated with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome are two forms of brain damage caused by thiamine deficiency.</p>
			<p>Wernicke encephalopathy damages regions of the brain called the thalamus and hypothalamus. This condition can cause:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>confusion</li>
				<li>memory loss</li>
				<li>loss of muscle coordination</li>
				<li>visual problems such as rapid eye movement and double vision</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Korsakoff syndrome is the result of permanent damage to the region of the brain where memories form. It can cause:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>loss of memory</li>
				<li>inability to form new memories</li>
				<li>hallucinations</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Causes</h3>
			<p>The main cause of beriberi is a diet low in thiamine. The disease is very rare in regions with access to vitamin-enriched foods, such as certain breakfast cereals and breads. Beriberi is most common in regions of the world where the diet includes unenriched, processed white rice, which only has a tenth of the amount of thiamine as brown rice.</p>
			<h3>Prevention</h3>
			<p>To prevent beriberi, eat a healthy, balanced diet that includes foods rich in thiamine. These include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>beans and legumes</li>
				<li>seeds</li>
				<li>meat</li>
				<li>fish</li>
				<li>whole grains</li>
				<li>nut</li>
				<li>dairy</li>
				<li>certain vegetables, such as asparagus, acorn squash, brussels sprouts, spinach, and beet greens</li>
				<li>breakfast cereals that are enriched with thiamine</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Treatment</h3>
			<p>Beriberi is easily treated with thiamine supplements. Your doctor may prescribe a thiamine shot or pill. For severe cases, a healthcare professional will administer intravenous thiamine.</p>
			<p>Your progress will be monitored with follow-up blood tests to see how well your body is absorbing the vitamin.</p>
